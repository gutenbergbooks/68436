<p class="ph2">ONLY A FARM BOY</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />


<small>AN ANGRY FARMER</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Hey</span> there, Dan Hardy, what ye doin’ now?”</p>

<p>“I’m oiling the corn sheller, Mr. Savage. It
needed it.”</p>

<p>“Huh! Guess ye wanted t’ take a rest, an’
that was your excuse fer it. Git t’ work now, an’
don’t let me see you loafin’ agin. What do ye
s’pose I keep ye fer, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“I’m trying to do the best I can,” replied Dan,
speaking respectfully but firmly to the miserly old
farmer for whom he worked for his board and
clothes.</p>

<p>“Th’ best ye can, eh? Wa’ll, some folks’ best
ain’t very good, t’ my way of thinkin’. Here
ye’ve been most all th’ mornin’ shellin’ a few
bushels of corn, an’ there’s lots of other chores t’
be done. Ye’ve go t’ git a hustle on ye, ef ye stay
’round here, an’ th’ sooner ye git that notion inter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
yer head th’ better it’ll be fer ye,” and the mean
farmer shook his fist in the boy’s face.</p>

<p>“I know I have to work for you, Mr. Savage,”
answered Dan, as he again began to turn the heavy
wheel of the corn sheller, and feed the yellow
ears into the chute. “I did not stop to rest, as you
suppose, but the sheller needed oiling. It was not
working right.”</p>

<p>“Guess ye thought it’d be a leetle easier if ye
put some grease on it, that’s what ye mean. An’ I
don’t want ye wastin’ my oil, nuther. Oil costs
money, I’d have ye know, and money is mighty
skurse these days.”</p>

<p>“I guess it is, as far as I’m concerned,” murmured
Dan to himself, as he bent his back to his
work. “I haven’t seen any money of my own in
so long that I don’t believe I’d recognize it if a
quarter of a dollar spoke to me,” and he smiled a
bit, in spite of the mean words of his employer.</p>

<p>“Now mind what I told ye,” went on the farmer,
as he started to leave the barn. “Don’t let
me catch ye loafin’ any more, or ye won’t git off
so easy.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Savage?”</p>

<p>“Never mind what I mean. Don’t you talk
back to me! Keep on turnin’ that sheller.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>Dan had stopped a moment in his work, while
he asked the question, and this seemed to further
anger Mr. Savage.</p>

<p>“Now mind,” concluded the man, as he left the
barn, “Lively’s the word on this farm, an’ ef I
catch any of my hired men loafin’ I’ll take it outer
their wages, that’s what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“He’d have hard work taking it out of mine,”
thought Dan, as his employer left him. “He’ll
have to cut off the tails of some of the old coats
he gives me, or shorten my trousers, or wear down
the old shoes so the soles are a little thinner.
That’s all the wages I get, except what I eat, and
goodness knows, if he begins to cut down on that,
I’ll be in a bad way.”</p>

<p>Mr. Savage, while one of the wealthiest farmers
in that locality, was considered by his neighbors
as a miserly sort of a man, and they were not
far from it. He owned over a hundred acres of
good farm and grazing land, with some timber, a
large house and substantial barns. His main farm
was about two miles from the village, though he
owned pastures and lots here and there throughout
the township. Some of this land he had come
into possession of by foreclosing mortgages in a
most peremptory manner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>Dan continued to work the corn sheller, a machine
built to take the kernels of corn from the
cob. He turned a big wheel with one hand, and
fed the ears into the chute with the other. From
a spout the yellow grains fell into a bushel basket,
while the cobs were tossed out on the other side
into a heap.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he meant, when he said I
wouldn’t get off so easy,” reflected Dan. “Could
he mean that he’ll whip me? I don’t believe I’d
stand that. I think I’d run away, though where I
could go, with no money, and only a few ragged
clothes, is more than I know. Oh, dear, I wish
mother was alive,” and in spite of himself tears
came into Dan’s eyes, for his mother had only
been dead about a year.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hardy had been a widow, and, with her
only son Dan, had lived just outside the village of
Hayden, in one of our Eastern states. Her husband
had left her a little money but she had had
to spend most of it for doctor’s bills, as her health
was very poor. Dan could not earn much in the
village, and they had had barely enough to live on.
When Mrs. Hardy died it took what little money
was left for the funeral, and Dan found himself
without a dollar in the world, and no friend or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
relative to aid him. The place he had in the general
store of Hank Lee, where he earned a mere
pittance, had been filled by another boy when Dan
had to stay home to take care of his mother in her
final illness.</p>

<p>It looked as if he would have to go to the poorhouse,
but, almost at the last moment, Peter Savage
had agreed to take the lad and give him board
and clothes in exchange for work. To this Dan
had agreed, but he had no idea how hard he would
have to toil.</p>

<p>He was continually kept busy doing “chores”
about the farm from early dawn until dark, and,
even then he was not through, for Susan Savage,
Peter’s wife, used to make Dan help with the
housework,—drying the dishes, blackening the
stove, and even doing the sweeping. She found
out Dan could do these things, as he had often
helped his mother.</p>

<p>“He’s almost as good as a hired girl,” Susan
confided to her husband, “and it’s cheaper to have
him than it is a girl.”</p>

<p>“Then make him work, Susan,” said Peter.
“Work is good fer boys. None of ’em gits half
enough.”</p>

<p>And so poor Dan worked until nearly every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
night he was so tired he could hardly sleep.</p>

<p>Dan had an ambition to be something more
than a mere farm-hand. He was better educated
than most boys in his circumstances, for his father
had been a school teacher in a neighboring village,
until failing health had caused him to resign his
position.</p>

<p>Mr. Hardy had instructed his son in several
branches, and the boy had a real love for learning,
though his opportunities were small.</p>

<p>Among his choicest possessions, and, in fact,
one of his very few left after the debts were paid
for his mother’s funeral, was a small case of books
of instruction.</p>

<p>When Dan went to work for Mr. Savage, the
boy thought he would have a chance to study, but
the miserly farmer was afraid Dan would waste
time over the volumes, and would not consent to
allow him any hour of leisure in which to advance
his lessons. Dan was thus forced to pore over
the books at night, and he had to be careful even
in this, as, had Mr. Savage or his wife caught
him at it, they would have scolded him for burning
kerosene oil.</p>

<p>Still Dan determined to educate himself, but it
was hard work. The other boys in the village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
used to laugh at him for trying to use correct language,
but Dan did not mind that. He hoped,
some day, to take a higher position in life than
that of “hired man” and he wanted to be ready
for it when the opportunity came. So he took
good care of his little case of books, though Mr.
Savage sneered at him, and often threatened to
throw them out if he caught Dan “wasting” his
time over them.</p>

<p>“I should like to run away from him,” thought
the boy, as he kept on with the tiresome labor of
shelling the corn, “only I’m afraid he’d make me
come back. I suppose he has some sort of a claim
on me until I’m of age, and that won’t be for five
years. Well, there’s no use kicking. I’ve got to
stand it.”</p>

<p>Dan was a well built, strong lad, and he was
healthy, which counts for a good deal. Consequently
his gloomy thoughts did not bother him
long. Still he did wish he could have it a little
easier in life. He would have liked to go fishing
once in a while, or take a long tramp through the
woods. But the only time he did not have to work
all day long was Sunday, and then his employer,
who was very strict as regards church, would not
hear of any one taking innocent pleasures on that
day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>As Dan continued to turn the corn sheller, a
shadow fell across the broad patch of sunlight
that streamed in the open barn door. It was the
shadow of a man, and Dan glanced up, expecting
to see the angry face of Mr. Savage. Instead he
beheld a stranger.</p>

<p>“Good morning, my lad,” spoke the man, in a
rather pleasant voice. “I see you are hard at
work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve got to get all this corn shelled to-day.”</p>

<p>“Are you acquainted in these parts?” inquired
the man, as he took a seat on an upturned peck
measure.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I’ve lived here all my life.”</p>

<p>“Then I guess you could tell me how far it is
to the village.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; it’s about two miles by the main
road.”</p>

<p>“Do you know all the people in the village?”
and the man looked sharply at Dan, who had
stopped his turning of the heavy wheel to answer
the questions.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly all of them; I know the names of
most of them.”</p>

<p>“And where they live too, I suppose?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>“I guess I could find almost any house.”</p>

<p>Dan was wondering why the man was asking
so many questions, and had about made up his
mind that the stranger was a book agent, for occasionally
such men visited the farm, though they
usually went to the house instead of the barn.</p>

<p>“Who keeps the general store in the village—let’s
see, it’s called Strawdon, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but that’s pretty near it. The name of
the town is Hayden.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Hayden. I remember now.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Dan, “it’s not very large.
There are probably five hundred persons in it. It
contains a bank, several stores, a grist mill, and
just outside of it is a box factory. Then there is
a town hall, where the selectmen meet once a
month, and a small library, but I don’t get much
chance to go there.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Savage doesn’t approve of books.”</p>

<p>“Do you like them?”</p>

<p>“I am fond of reading and study, but I don’t
get much opportunity.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad. Who did you say kept the
general store in the village?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say,” replied Dan with a smile, “but
Hank Lee keeps it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“Do you know him?”</p>

<p>“I used to work for him.”</p>

<p>“He has a brother; hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“I believe he has, but I never saw him. He
does not live in this part of the country.”</p>

<p>“What’s his name; do you know?”</p>

<p>“Simon, I believe. I am not sure, but I think I
have heard Mr. Lee refer to him by that name.
He seldom spoke of him.”</p>

<p>“Do you know why?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” and Dan must have shown some surprise
at the number of questions the man was asking,
for the latter added:</p>

<p>“Please don’t think I am too inquisitive. I’m
a stranger around here, and I’m looking for some
friends. I thought the storekeeper would be the
best man to inform me, and I should like to know
a little about him, before I call on him.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you very much about him,” replied
Dan, “as, even though I worked for him for
a time, he never told me much about himself or
his brother.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t care about his brother,” said the
stranger quickly. “I only asked out of curiosity.
I suppose there is a doctor in the village?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, Dr. Maxwell.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>“Where is his house?”</p>

<p>“It’s a big red one, just off the road that goes
to Flagtown.”</p>

<p>“Are there any houses near it?”</p>

<p>“No, the nearest one is about an eighth of a
mile away.”</p>

<p>“Well, you seem to know this locality pretty
well. I wonder—”</p>

<p>What the stranger was about to remark he did
not state, as, at that moment another shadow
moved across the sunlit patch, and the man
jumped up quickly, looking nervously about him.
It was Mr. Savage who suddenly appeared, and,
for a moment he did not notice the stranger.</p>

<p>“Wa’all, ye good-fer-nothin’ lazy boy, loafin’
ag’in, are ye!” exclaimed Mr. Savage in an angry
voice. “I caught ye at it! That’s what I git fer
savin’ ye from th’ poorhouse! I’ll teach ye t’ waste
my valuable time! I’ll—”</p>

<p>“Mr. Savage, I only stopped for a few moments
to answer some questions this gentleman
was asking me,” said Dan boldly, motioning to the
well dressed stranger. “I could not talk and shell
corn at the same time, for he could not hear what
I said. I’m sorry—”</p>

<p>“It’s all my fault,” broke in the stranger. “I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
was making some inquiries of the lad, and I regret
if he has incurred your displeasure. I’m sure I’ll
willingly pay for his time, as the information he
gave was worth it,” and the man took out a well-filled
wallet. At the sight of the money it contained,
and at the mention of the word “pay” a
change came over the face of Mr. Savage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br />


<small>THE DANGEROUS BULL</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Why</span>, of course,” began Mr. Savage, while he
scraped some mud off his boots with a stick, “ye
know this corn has all got t’ be shelled t’ day, an’
when Dan stops, th’ work ain’t goin’ on. Work
is money, an’ when he don’t work I lose jest so
much money.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” replied the stranger quickly. “I
am a business man myself, and I’m willing to pay
for whatever time I kept this young man from his
work. I guess we can figure it out. We’ll say I
took up about ten minutes of his time. That’s one
sixth of an hour. Now how much do you pay him
by the hour?”</p>

<p>“I don’t pay him by the hour,” replied Mr.
Savage, a little confused.</p>

<p>“Well, by the day, then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t pay him by th’ day, nuther.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see. You hire him by the week.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“No, sir, not exactly. Dan, git on with that
shellin’. There ain’t no call fer ye t’ stand loafin’
now. Me an’ this gentleman kin settle our
business between ourselves.”</p>

<p>The truth was he did not want Dan to hear
what was said, as Mr. Savage was just a little bit
ashamed of himself. Dan began feeding the yellow
ears into the chute, but the noise of the sheller
did not prevent him hearing what was said
further.</p>

<p>“Then if you’ll tell me what his week’s wages
are, I think I can figure out what I owe you,”
and the stranger took out pencil and paper.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, he don’t exactly work by the week
nuther.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, I’d forgotten. Farm hands generally
work for so much a month and their board.
What are his monthly wages?”</p>

<p>“Look a-here!” exclaimed Mr. Savage. “That’s
my affair. What right ye got t’ come around here,
askin’ me my business?”</p>

<p>“No right,” replied the stranger coolly, “only
I wanted to make up for the time I kept this boy
from his work.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I guess ef ye give me a quarter we’ll
call it square.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“I’m satisfied if you are,” replied the stranger,
passing over the money. “Twenty-five cents for
ten minutes, is at the rate of a dollar and a half an
hour. In ten hours, which, I believe, is the farm
day, he earns fifteen dollars. That’s very good
wages for a boy like him.”</p>

<p>“Look a-here!” blustered Mr. Savage. “I don’t
pay him no fifteen dollars a day, an’ ye know it.
No farm-hand gits that much; I don’t myself. But
if ye come around here, stickin’ yer nose in my business,
ye got t’ pay fer it, that’s all. Now ye’d better
git away from here fer I might charge ye rent,”
and he grinned in a malicious manner.</p>

<p>“Thank you, I’m just about to leave,” said the
man, as he walked out of the barn.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, ye’d better.”</p>

<p>The stranger smiled as he walked away, and
Dan, watching him, saw him take a little red book
out of his pocket, and write something in it.</p>

<p>“Do ye know that man?” asked Mr. Savage,
turning to Dan, when the stranger was out of
sight down the road, which ran in front of the
barn.</p>

<p>“No, sir. He came in here and began asking
me questions.”</p>

<p>“What kind?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“About the people and houses in the village.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Some pesky book agent, I’ll bet half
a cooky.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what he was,” replied Dan. “He
said he was looking for a friend, and he wanted to
know about Mr. Lee’s brother, Simon.”</p>

<p>“That good-for-nothing? Wa’al, ef he’s a
friend of Simon Lee, I ain’t got no use fer him.
Now you git on with yer work, an’ don’t stand
talkin’ here all day. Ye’ve got t’ shell that corn
before night, or ye’ll have t’ do it after ye help
Mrs. Savage with th’ house work.”</p>

<p>Dan again bent his back to the task, turning the
big wheel faster to make up for the time he had
lost through no fault of his own. Mr. Savage
pocketed the quarter the man had given him,
first biting it to see that it was not a lead
one.</p>

<p>“When ye git done here I want ye t’ go down
t’ th’ south pasture, an’ let th’ old black bull out,
an’ inter the upper lot,” he called to Dan, raising
his voice to be heard above the noise of the corn
sheller. “Ye’ll have t’ be mighty spry, too, fer
he’s as ugly as sin, an’ he’ll break out of the pasture
ef he git’s a chance.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful,” promised Dan.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>As the boy went on with his work, after his employer
had left him, he could not help thinking of
the rather mysterious stranger, who had asked so
many questions.</p>

<p>“I wonder what he wanted?” he said to himself.
“Perhaps he was a new doctor, looking for
a place to establish a practice. But I don’t believe
Hayden is big enough for two doctors. Maybe,
as Mr. Savage says, he’s a book agent. He
seemed to have plenty of money. He figured out
I get fifteen dollars a day. Land! if I got fifteen
cents for myself I’d be lucky,” and Dan
sighed.</p>

<p>It was afternoon before he had finished shelling
the corn, and he was quite tired. Yet he rather
welcomed the long walk to the south pasture to
let the bull into the upper lot. The animal was a
large one, and was well known about the countryside
as a savage creature, somewhat like his
owner.</p>

<p>“I hope he doesn’t get out,” thought Dan, as he
neared the pasture. “I guess the best way would
be to go in quietly, so he doesn’t catch sight of me,
let down the bars leading into the upper lot, and
then show myself. The bull will begin to run
around as he always does, then he’ll notice that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the bars are down, and he’ll go just where I want
him to.”</p>

<p>Dan saw the bull quietly feeding off in one corner
of the pasture. The boy managed to get in
without attracting the animal’s attention, and let
down the bars leading into the south lot, where
the grass was better, for that was the reason Mr.
Savage wanted the animal shifted from one spot
to the other.</p>

<p>All would have gone well, but for the fact, of
which Dan was not aware, that there was a weak
place in the fence enclosing the upper lot, where
the bull was expected to go. When the bars were
down Dan shouted to attract the animal’s attention,
and then he took a safe position outside the
fence.</p>

<p>The black bull came forward on the run, thinking
some fool-hardy person had dared to dispute
his rights. The animal caught sight of the lowered
bars, and, a moment later had done just as
Dan expected, run into the upper lot.</p>

<p>Then something else happened. The bull, who
was up to all such tricks, saw a weak spot in the
fence. At it he went, full tilt, and, a moment later
was off down the road bellowing and kicking up a
cloud of dust.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>“The bull has escaped!” cried Dan. “Oh, what
shall I do? He may kill somebody before he’s
caught! Mr. Savage will blame me!” and he
started down the highway in pursuit of the ugly
animal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />


<small>UP A TREE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> upper lot and south pasture belonging to
Mr. Savage were some distance away from the
farm, and on a road that was not much used.
However, this road connected with the main highway,
near the village, and Dan’s fear was that the
bull would run into town, creating no end of damage.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I can catch him?” the boy thought.
“He’s a swift animal. Oh, dear! I hope he doesn’t
meet any girl or woman with a red dress, or
there’ll be a terrible time. I wonder why bulls
hate red so? But I guess I’d better stop wondering
about that, and begin to think how I can stop
him, if I do catch him.”</p>

<p>Dan remembered that the bull had a ring in his
nose, and to the ring was attached a stout cord,
the other end being looped to a buckle in a sort of
halter on the animal’s head.</p>

<p>“If I had some sort of a hook I could catch it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
in the rope or ring, and hold the bull back,” he
thought. “It would have to be a pretty long hook,
for I wouldn’t dare go very close to the savage
animal. I have it! I’ll cut a long pole, with a
prong on one end, and I can hook that in the cord,
perhaps.”</p>

<p>Dan saw a tree that might provide what he
wanted, and he lost little time in cutting a long
pole. He trimmed off all the branches but one
near the end, and this left him a very good substitute
for a hook. The trimming he did as he ran
along.</p>

<p>The bull was now out of sight, around a turn
in the road, but there was a cloud of dust by which
Dan could trace the animal’s movement.</p>

<p>In a little while Dan, still running as fast as he
could, met a man driving a horse, attached to a
light carriage. The horse seemed frightened, and
the man was pale.</p>

<p>“Was that your bull that just ran up the road?”
the man asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir; it belongs to Mr. Savage.”</p>

<p>“It does, eh? Where is he?”</p>

<p>“At the farm. The bull got out of the lot.”</p>

<p>“I guess you mean that you let it out! That’s
the way with careless boys. I want to tell you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
that the beast frightened my horse, and it nearly
ran away. Part of the harness was broken, and I
expect Mr. Savage to pay for it. You can tell him
that I say so. My name’s Sam Battle, and I’m
always ready for a fight, too. You can tell him
that.”</p>

<p>“Was the bull going fast?” asked Dan, more
anxious to catch up to the animal, than to hear
about the man’s characteristics.</p>

<p>“Fast? Well, you’d ought to have seen him.
He’ll do a lot of damage, before he gets off the
rampage, and Mr. Savage will have a heavy bill
to settle. You’d better hurry up, if you want to
catch him, and don’t forget I’ve got to have pay
for the broken harness.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Mr. Savage will threaten to get that
out of me in some way,” thought Dan, as he hurried
on, almost out of breath.</p>

<p>As he went around a turn in the road he saw an
elderly woman stooping over a basket that had contained
eggs. It was easy to see what had been
in the basket, for, all about her, was a pool of
whites and yellows from the broken shells. She
was trying to pick out a few whole ones, and, in
the process her hands had become all daubed up
with the sticky substance.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Hi, boy!” she called to Dan. “Come and help
me gather up these eggs.”</p>

<p>“I can’t,” said Dan, respectfully. “I’ve got to
catch the bull.”</p>

<p>“Was that your bull?”</p>

<p>“It belongs to the man I work for.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know you now. You’re Dan Hardy,
and you live out to Mr. Savage’s farm. Well, he’ll
have a nice bill from me, I can tell you. There
was fourteen dozen eggs in that basket, and I was
takin’ ’em to Hank Lee’s store to trade fer groceries.
Now I don’t believe there’s half a dozen
eggs left. He’ll have to pay fer ’em, that’s what
he’ll have t’ do!”</p>

<p>“Did the bull run into you, Mrs. Dowden?”
asked Dan anxiously, as he recognized the old
lady.</p>

<p>“No, Dan, he didn’t exactly run into me, but
when I saw the savage critter comin’ I just sot my
basket of eggs down in the middle of the road, an’
I ran under a fence until he got by.”</p>

<p>“Then how did the eggs get broken?”</p>

<p>“Why, that savage black critter jest stomped up
and down on that basket of eggs until they are
what you see now—nothin’ but a mess of whites
an’ yallers. That bull jest did it out of spite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
’cause I s’pose he couldn’t eat ’em. Then he gives
a bellow, stuck his tail up in the air, and run on.
Oh, he’ll do a lot of damage ’fore he gits through.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” began Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t s’pose it’s your fault,” said Mrs. Dowden,
as she managed to rescue one whole egg
from the mess. “But I’ll have the law on Peter
Savage, if he don’t pay me fer these eggs, an’
they’re wuth thirty cents a dozen now at store
prices, too. Land sakes! I never see a bull stomp
on eggs afore, an’ I don’t want to see it ag’in.”</p>

<p>But Dan did not stay to hear what the elderly
lady had to say. He left her standing in the middle
of a little lake of whites and yellows, and continued
on his way after the bull.</p>

<p>As Dan was hurrying along a straight stretch
of road, with the bull some distance ahead of him,
he saw a man walking just in advance of the animal.
The man had come across lots and emerged
upon the highway without seeing the bull.</p>

<p>“I hope old Pullox (which was the bull’s name)
doesn’t attack that man,” thought Dan. “Perhaps
he’ll run right by.”</p>

<p>But this, evidently, was not what the bull was
going to do. Dan could hear the animal give a
bellow of rage, then it halted, pounded the ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
with its fore feet, and prepared to charge on the
man.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Dan, giving a shout of warning.</p>

<p>But there was no need of it, for the man had
heard the noise made by the bull. He turned
around quickly and saw the angry animal about to
attack him.</p>

<p>“Run!” shouted Dan.</p>

<p>The man did so, and not a moment too soon.
The bull was after him like a flash, and Dan, using
his little remaining wind, redoubled his pace, hoping
to be able to aid the man.</p>

<p>On and on went the bull in pursuit. There were
two clouds of dust now; a small one, raised by the
fleeing man, and a larger one, kicked up by the
bull.</p>

<p>“He may kill him!” thought Dan. “Isn’t this
the worst luck!”</p>

<p>The man gave a look behind him. The bull was
nearer. Then he did the only thing feasible under
the circumstances. He climbed a tree, scrambling
up it with a speed that did not seem possible in
such a stout person, for he was quite fat.</p>

<p>“Stay there! Stay there!” cried Dan, as he ran
up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>“That’s just what I intend to do, young fellow,”
the man answered, panting from his exertions.</p>

<p>“What do you s’pose—Why, if it isn’t Dan
Hardy!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Lee” exclaimed Dan, recognizing
the crusty storekeeper for whom he had once
worked. “I didn’t know you at first.”</p>

<p>“No, and no one else would either, the way I
had to run to escape being killed by that ugly critter.
You let him loose on purpose, that’s what
you did.”</p>

<p>“On purpose, Mr. Lee?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s what you done. I know you! You
wanted to pay me back for not taking you into my
store again, and you thought you’d get even. I’ll
have the law on you for this!”</p>

<p>The bull was now pawing around the foot of the
tree, paying no attention to Dan, but, seemingly,
very anxious to get at the storekeeper.</p>

<p>“You have no right to talk that way, Mr. Lee,”
spoke Dan firmly. “You know I had nothing to
do with the bull chasing you. I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you let the bull loose?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. He broke out of the upper lot, when
I was changing him from the south pasture. There
was a weak place in the fence.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>“Well, you knowed it was there, and you done
it on purpose, and I’m goin’ to have the law on
you for it. I’ve got a weak heart, and I may die
from being chased this way. I feel bad now. I’ll
make you pay the doctor bills and the funeral expenses,
too, that’s what I will.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, and I hope you’ll not be sick,” responded
the lad. “But if you are, I haven’t a
cent to pay any bills with.”</p>

<p>The bull was running around the tree in a circle,
pawing the ground and bellowing.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take the ugly critter away?”
demanded Mr. Lee, holding tightly to a branch,
for he was afraid of falling out of the tree.</p>

<p>“I want to, but I can’t get a chance to hook this
pole into the ring. If I could he’d come along
peaceably enough.”</p>

<p>“You’re keeping me up here for spite!” declared
the man. “You picked out this lonely spot, where
there’s no houses, on purpose.”</p>

<p>Dan did not take the trouble to answer the unreasonable
man. He was watching his chance to
catch the prong into the cord or ring in the bull’s
nose. But the creature, while it showed no disposition
to attack Dan, was keeping out of the boy’s
reach.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>“Aren’t you going to take the critter away?” demanded
the man again. “I’ve got important business
at my store, and if I’m delayed I’ll charge you
damages, and heavy ones too.”</p>

<p>“I guess the way you’d figure it out, I now owe
you more than I can ever pay,” replied Dan more
coolly, as he saw the bull was evidently not likely
to run any farther. “I’ll get him away if I can.
I’ll have to get you to help me. If you’ll stick one
foot out, on the other side of the tree, and make
believe you’re coming down, you may attract his attention
there, and I can sneak behind him and slip
the stick into the ring. Just put your foot down a
ways.”</p>

<p>“I know you! You want the bull to injure me!”
cried Mr. Lee. “I see your trick! You want me
to get hurt so I can’t sue you. But I’ll sue just the
same.”</p>

<p>“Look here!” exclaimed Dan, in desperation.
“If you want to get down out of that tree, and if
you want me to take the bull away, you’ve got to
help me. If you don’t do as I say I’ll have to
leave the bull here until I can go and get help.”</p>

<p>“Don’t do that! Don’t do that!” begged Mr.
Lee in terror. “Don’t leave me alone with that savage
critter. I’ll do whatever you say. What is it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Dan? I always liked you. You’re a good boy.
I—I wish I’d given you back your place in the
store, but I couldn’t do it. I had to have somebody.
You’re a good boy, Dan. You won’t hold
a grudge against an old man like me. Don’t go
off, and leave me all alone. I’ll do as you say.
Which foot shall I stick down?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make much difference,” replied Dan,
hardly able to keep back a smile at the change of
manner in the man. “Either one will do. I want
you to attract the bull’s attention, until I can sneak
up behind him.”</p>

<p>“All right, Dan. I’ll do it. But don’t go off
and leave me alone,” and the storekeeper prepared
to lower his foot. At the first sign of movement
on the part of the man up the tree the bull ceased
going about in a circle and stood still.</p>

<p>“I’ll get him now!” cried Dan.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />


<small>THE STRANGER AGAIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> the maddened animal had its attention
fixed on Mr. Lee it did not observe what Dan
was doing. The boy went quietly behind the bull,
extended the stick, and, a moment later had caught
the prong in the ring in the brute’s nose.</p>

<p>“Now you’ve got him! Now you’ve got him,
Dan!” cried the storekeeper, as he hastily drew his
leg up. “Hold him tight! Don’t let him get
away!”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to.”</p>

<p>“Take him away! Lead him way off!”</p>

<p>“I will. I’ll take him back to the south pasture,
where the fence is good and strong.”</p>

<p>As soon as the bull felt the tugging of the ring
in its sensitive nose it ceased its attempt to get at
Mr. Lee. The big creature calmed down and allowed
Dan to lead it away, though it did not go
very willingly. Dan kept a firm hold of the stick,
and, as long as he did so the bull could not approach
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“You can come down now, Mr. Lee,” said the
boy as he started along the road with the animal.</p>

<p>“Do you think it would be safe?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he can’t get away from me now.”</p>

<p>The storekeeper slid to the ground. He was a
little stiff from his climbing, and running, and his
clothes were rather out of place.</p>

<p>“I’d like to shoot you, you miserable creature!”
he exclaimed, shaking his fist at the bull.</p>

<p>“It’s too valuable an animal to shoot,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“I don’t care whether it is or not, I’d like to
shoot it. And you can tell Peter Savage that I’m
going to sue him and you too for the trouble you
caused me.”</p>

<p>“It was not my fault, Mr. Lee.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care whose fault it was, I’m going to
sue. You did this on purpose, and I’ll fix you
for it too, Dan Hardy.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Lee—”</p>

<p>“Don’t you talk back to me. I said I’m going
to fix you for this and I will.”</p>

<p>Dan saw it would be of little use to further
argue with the man, so he turned away and gave
his whole attention to managing the bull, which
was bellowing hoarsely and pawing the earth.</p>

<p>Mr. Lee kept on down the road, muttering to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
himself, almost as angry, Dan thought, as was the
bull.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t my fault,” remarked the boy to himself,
“still I suppose I will be blamed for it.”</p>

<p>Nor was his anticipation disappointed. When
he had put the bull back in the south pasture where
the animal had first been kept, he returned to the
farm. Some news of what had happened had already
preceded him.</p>

<p>“Wa’ll, this is a pretty how-d’-do!” exclaimed
Mr. Savage, as Dan went to the barn, where his
master was feeding the horses for the night.
“What ails ye, anyhow? Can’t ye do anything
right?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Mr. Savage?”</p>

<p>“Jest what I say. What made you let that bull
out an’ cause a lot of damage? Oh, I know all
about it. Mrs. Dowden sent her boy over to see
me, and she says I’ve got to pay for th’ eggs th’
bull smashed. It’s all your fault.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t,” replied Dan firmly, but respectfully.
“I did not know there was a loose place in the
fence of the upper lot. You told me to let the bull
in there and I did so. I could not help his breaking
down the fence.”</p>

<p>“Did ye put th’ critter back safe?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>“Yes, sir, but it got Mr. Lee up a tree before I
could do so,” and then, fearing Mr. Savage might
get a wrong account of the various happenings
from the persons involved, Dan told exactly what
had happened.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, ye’re a nice sort of boy t’ have around
a farm, I must say!” exclaimed Mr. Savage sarcastically.
“Ye’re doin’ more harm than ye be
good! Now I s’pose I’ll have a lot of damages
t’ pay. Why don’t ye have some sense about ye?
Good land o’ Tunket! I’ll be in the poorhouse
ef I don’t look out.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry it happened,” said poor Dan. “I
didn’t—”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk t’ me!” interrupted Mr. Savage.
“I’ve seen enough of ye fer one day. Here, ef ye
kin do it without gittin’ int’ trouble, finish waterin’
them hosses. I’m goin’ t’ th’ village t’ see ef I
can’t make some arrangement with Lee ’fore he
sues me. He’s liable t’ do it.”</p>

<p>Dan was in very low spirits. Everything seemed
to be going against him, and it is not to his discredit
to say that he cried just a little as he fed the
horses, and gave them water. He was very lonely,
and he missed his mother very much.</p>

<p>As he entered the stall of the chestnut mare, an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
animal he frequently drove, the animal put her soft
nose down on the boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Good Bess,” he murmured. “I wonder if you
care for me? There doesn’t any one else seem to
around here.”</p>

<p>The mare whinnied, for she was fond of the boy,
who was always kind to her.</p>

<p>Dan had little time for grief or reflection, however,
as, before he was quite through with watering
the animals, Mrs. Savage blew the horn for
supper, the house being across the road from the
barn. To the horn’s strident note she added her
own voice:</p>

<p>“Now come along lively, Dan. I can’t keep supper
all night fer a lazy, good-fer-nothin’ boy. I
want t’ git th’ dishes washed up, an’ ye’ve got t’ dry
’em. Hurry up with that work, an’ don’t dawdle
over it all night.”</p>

<p>Dan hurriedly finished with the horses and went
into the house. The two hired men of the farm
were already at the table, eating very fast, as if
they feared some one would take the victuals away
before they were through. They nodded to Dan
who, after a hasty wash in the tin basin outside,
took his place.</p>

<p>The kitchen was the room most in use in Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
Savage’s house. There the meals were served,
and, what little leisure time the hired men had,
they spent there, when they were not at the village
store, talking with their cronies.</p>

<p>The room was of fair size, and contained a
large range, which made it very hot in summer
time; a sink and pump, and a large mantlepiece,
over which hung an old musket, that Mr. Savage
said his grandfather had used in the Revolutionary
War. Some of his acquaintances remarked that
Mr. Savage was too cowardly to go to war himself,
so he had no relics of the great Civil conflict.</p>

<p>Adjoining the kitchen was a sort of dairy and
meal room, where Mrs. Savage kept the feed for
numerous chickens. What with that, and the fact
that a wood-shed, where fuel was kept, also opened
out of this apartment, and with the hot stove and
the smell of cooking, the kitchen was not the most
cheerful place in the world.</p>

<p>“Don’t be all night over yer meal now,” said
Mrs. Savage with a cross look at Dan. “Ye’ve
made trouble enough as it is, an’ Mr. Savage had
t’ go ’way without supper t’ see Mr. Lee ’count of
that bull. Ye’ve got t’ help me with th’ work, fer
I’m goin’t’ set bread.”</p>

<p>Dan did not reply, and to the questions from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the hired men, who asked them when Mrs. Savage
was out of the room, he told as little as possible of
the bull incident.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” consoled Jonas Hannock, one
of the men, as he finished his piece of apple pie,
and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Never mind, Dan. Bad luck can’t last forever,”
for which little sympathy the boy was grateful.</p>

<p>He was tired, not only from his work on the
farm, but from his chase after the bull, still he
could not rest.</p>

<p>“Come now, git th’ dishes picked up,” called
Mrs. Savage, before Dan was quite through.
“Ye’ve been long enough. Ye might as well
wash ’em too, while ye’re at it. I kin git more
work done then.”</p>

<p>Of all the work about the farm or house Dan
hated most of all doing the dishes, but there
seemed to be no escape from it. With as good
grace as possible he began at them, and he had
about finished when Mrs. Savage exclaimed:</p>

<p>“There! I haven’t got a yeast cake, Dan; ye’ll
have t’ go t’ th’ village an’ git one. Hurry too.
Don’t stand gawpin’ along th’ road. Tell Mr.
Lee t’ charge it.”</p>

<p>This seemed the last straw. After his hard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
day’s work to be forced to take a four mile walk
before he could go to bed!</p>

<p>“Shall I saddle the horse?” he asked timidly,
thinking of how much easier it would be to gallop
in on the back of Bess.</p>

<p>“Saddle a hoss? Wa’ll, I guess not! Them
hosses has done work enough fer one day.”</p>

<p>Dan thought he had also.</p>

<p>He started off on the errand, vainly wishing
Mrs. Savage had discovered the need of a yeast
cake when Mr. Savage drove to the village, as he
could have brought it back with him. Still, after
he was started, walking along the highway in the
pleasant summer evening, some of Dan’s weariness
left him.</p>

<p>As he neared the cross road, on which Dr.
Maxwell lived, he heard some one walking on the
hard highway.</p>

<p>“I wonder if that’s the doctor,” he thought.
“No, it can’t be. He always rides.”</p>

<p>A few seconds later a man came into view. It
was not very dark yet, and Dan easily recognized
the stranger as the person who had asked him so
many questions in the barn.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, it is the corn-sheller boy,” remarked the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
stranger. “How are you? Did you finish all that
corn?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I’ve got just as much more to do to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad. You seem to have to work
pretty hard.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I suppose all boys do.”</p>

<p>“Not all, nor all men either.”</p>

<p>“If you’re looking for Dr. Maxwell’s house, it’s
right down that road.”</p>

<p>“What makes you think I am looking for his
house?” and the man seemed annoyed.</p>

<p>“Well, you were asking about him—”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. I don’t want to see him. I
just wanted to know where he lived, out of curiosity.
But I’m in a hurry, so I’ll have to leave
you,” and the man, who a moment ago seemed to
have plenty of time, turned off in the other direction
and hurried away.</p>

<p>“That’s queer,” thought Dan. “He acted as if
he was mad because I told him where Dr. Maxwell
lived. I wonder what he is doing in this
neighborhood?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />


<small>THE OLD BLACKSMITH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dan</span> saw no prospect of his question being answered
immediately, so, after listening to the retreating
footsteps of the stranger he resumed his
journey to the village.</p>

<p>“I hope Mr. Lee isn’t in,” said the boy to himself,
as he neared the store. “He might say something
unpleasant, and there are usually a lot of
men in his place evenings. I hope I don’t meet
him until he has had a chance to forget about the
bull.”</p>

<p>As Dan was walking along the village street he
was hailed by a youth about his own age.</p>

<p>“Hi, Dan! When ye goin’ t’ give an exhibition?”</p>

<p>“What sort of an exhibition, Tom?”</p>

<p>“Masterin’ wild bulls! I herd ye was pretty
good at it,” and the boy laughed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>Dan knew by this that his experience with the
animal, which had treed Mr. Lee, was pretty well
known in the village. Still he hoped that he would
not meet the storekeeper when he went in for the
yeast cake. Nor did he, a clerk waiting on him
and giving him what he wanted.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Mr. Lee about the store,
which was filled with the usual crowd of loungers.
Nobody, however, seemed to notice Dan.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I didn’t see him,” thought the boy as
he was on his way home.</p>

<p>As Dan neared the place where he had met the
mysterious stranger he thought he saw the figure
of a man crossing the lots, near the turn of the
road. He had half a notion to investigate, and
see if it was the man who had appeared to take
such an interest in him, but the thought of Mrs.
Savage waiting for the yeast cake made him fear
this would not be advisable. So he kept on,
although as he walked along the grass by the roadside,
he was almost sure he heard the footsteps of
some one on the highway.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, why didn’t ye stay all night?” demanded
Mrs. Savage very ungraciously when Dan,
who was very tired, came in. He did not
answer, and, as there was no further demand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
made on him, except to see that the henhouse was
locked, he went up to bed.</p>

<p>Hard work is a good thing in one way, for it
brings refreshing sleep. When Dan awoke the next
morning he felt much better, physically and mentally.
It was a bright, beautiful day, and when he
was dressing he could hear the songs of birds, in
the trees opposite his window.</p>

<p>“I hope things go well to-day,” the boy thought.
“I haven’t got much to be thankful for, but I can
be glad it isn’t raining. Still, if it was, I suppose
I’d have to shell corn in the barn.”</p>

<p>He started to whistle a merry tune, but was
rudely interrupted by a call from below:</p>

<p>“Come now!” cried Mr. Savage. “Going t’
lay abed all day? Stir yer stumps up there, Dan.
There’s work t’ be done, an’ I hope ye don’t expect
me t’ do all of it! Move lively, git yer breakfast
an’ shell some more corn!”</p>

<p>Dan hurried with his dressing, spent little time
over his washing operations, and was soon hurrying
with his breakfast. Everything seemed to be
“hurry” with him. He had no time for leisure
with such a task-master over him as Peter Savage.</p>

<p>Dan was about half through with his morning’s
work of shelling corn for the horses, when Mr.
Savage appeared in the barn.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>“Is that all ye got done?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I worked as fast as I could.”</p>

<p>“Fast! Humph, I guess ye must a’ turned it
backward part of th’ time. Now git a move on
ye. Mrs. Savage want’s ye t’ go t’ th’ store fer
some molasses. Don’t be all day, nuther.”</p>

<p>“Shall I hitch up?”</p>

<p>“Hitch up? Not much. Ye kin walk, can’t
ye?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, but I thought I might bring back
some bran; we need it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tend t’ that. Hustle now, an’ walk fast.”</p>

<p>Dan did not mind the walk so much this morning,
as it would rest his back from the wearisome
labor of turning the corn sheller. He got the molasses
jug and started off, striking up a whistling
chorus.</p>

<p>“Oh, let up on that!” exclaimed Mrs. Savage
who was in no very good humor, because the bread
had not “come up” properly. “Boys is always
makin’ useless noises. Ye’ll walk faster ef ye
don’t whistle, an’ I want that molasses t’ make a
Johnny cake fer dinner.”</p>

<p>Dan ceased his whistling until he was out of the
hearing of Mrs. Savage, and then he began again.</p>

<p>“It looks as if I’d get into trouble again before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
night,” he thought. “I wonder what makes some
people so mean, anyhow?”</p>

<p>Dan’s meditation was interrupted by hearing a
wagon coming behind him. He looked to see who
it was, and the man driving the horse called out,
at the sight of the boy:</p>

<p>“Hello, Dan. Going to the village, I suppose?
Don’t you want a ride? There’s plenty of
room.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Harrison. I wouldn’t mind
a lift,” and Dan climbed up on the seat beside
Holman Harrison, the village blacksmith, a kindly
old man, and a veteran of the Civil War. He had
known Dan’s father and mother, and had been acquainted
with Dan ever since the lad was a baby.
In fact Mr. Harrison was the one person in the
village whom Dan could think of as a friend.</p>

<p>“Going after vinegar?” asked the blacksmith,
noticing the jug Dan carried.</p>

<p>“No, Mr. Harrison, molasses.”</p>

<p>“Going to catch flies?”</p>

<p>“Catch flies? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Well, you know there’s an old saying, that it’s
easier to catch flies with molasses than it is with
vinegar, and I thought perhaps Mrs. Savage was
going to try it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“I guess she wouldn’t waste vinegar or molasses
that way. She’d drive the flies out with a
broom.”</p>

<p>“Yes, she and Peter are pretty ‘close’ I guess.
How do you like it there?”</p>

<p>“It might be worse.” Dan was not going to
“tattle” about his employer.</p>

<p>“And that means it isn’t very good,” said the
blacksmith shrewdly. “I know Peter Savage, and
he’s a hard man to work for. I wish I could help
you, Dan, for the sake of your mother and father,
who often did me good turns, but I can barely
make a living for myself. Times are very hard. I
had to walk five miles to-day to get the job of repairing
this wagon. The man said if I’d come after
it I could fix it for him, so I tramped after it,
borrowed his horse and I’m taking the wagon to
my shop. When I get it fixed I’ll drive back with
it. Otherwise you wouldn’t see me riding around
like this. As it is I’ll have to walk back.”</p>

<p>“I hope you will meet some one who will give
you a lift,” said Dan, with a smile.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I will. Still I’m good and strong yet,
if I am old, and have a bullet in my leg from the
battle of Antietam. I can limp along with the best
of ’em.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Does it hurt you very much?”</p>

<p>“Only just before a storm. Curious, but that
Confederate bullet is as good as a barometer. I
can tell for sure when it’s going to rain. When I
can’t make a living blacksmithing any more I’m
going to hire out as a weather prophet,” and the
veteran laughed heartily at his misfortune.</p>

<p>The two chatted pleasantly during the ride, the
blacksmith, at Dan’s request, relating some of his
war experiences. In turn Mr. Harrison sought to
draw from the boy something about his life at the
Savage farm, but Dan was not the one to complain,
even if he did have it hard.</p>

<p>“I know it can’t be very pleasant there for you,”
said the old soldier, “and I wish I could take you
with me, but, as I said, I have hard enough work
to get along. Still, Dan, don’t forget I’m your
friend, no matter what happens, and if I can ever
do anything for you, just let me know.”</p>

<p>A little later they drove into the village, and, as
Mr. Harrison turned the horse down the side
street leading to his shop, Dan saw the mysterious
stranger standing in front of Mr. Johnson’s shoe
store.</p>

<p>“There he is again!” exclaimed the boy. “I
wonder what he can be doing around here.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“That man,” and Dan pointed to him.</p>

<p>“What? Do you know him too?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t exactly know him, but I’ve talked
with him,” and Dan related what had passed between
himself and the man. “Do you know who
he is, Mr. Harrison?”</p>

<p>“No, except he says he’s an inventor. He came
into my place yesterday, and got me to fix some
sort of a tool. I never saw one like it before. It
was like a long chisel, or a big tack lifter. I
thought it might be for taking up carpets, and I
asked him, but he said it was a new tool he had invented,
and that he wasn’t at liberty to tell me
what it was for. It had broken in two, and I
welded it together for him. When I saw he didn’t
want to talk, I didn’t ask him any more questions.
He’s a queer man, but he seems to have plenty of
money. But, if you’re going to Mr. Lee’s store,
you’d better get out here. Sorry I can’t give you a
ride back.”</p>

<p>“You’ve given me a good lift as it was,” said
Dan, as he alighted with the molasses jug. The
blacksmith turned off into another street, and, as
Dan started for the general store, he saw the
stranger waving his hand to some one. Turning
to see who it was, Dan beheld a rather poorly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
dressed individual join the man in front of the shoe
store.</p>

<p>“Well, he evidently knows some one in the village,”
thought Dan.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />


<small>SOME BAD MONEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Feeling</span> that he had no time to lose watching
the movements of the stranger and the poorly
dressed man, though he vaguely wondered what
their objects might be. Dan hurried on to Hank
Lee’s store. He saw the proprietor behind the
counter.</p>

<p>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” exclaimed Mr. Lee, in
rather a surly tone, as he saw Dan. “I hope you
haven’t got any wild bulls outside.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Dan, unable to repress a
smile at the thought of Mr. Lee up a tree.</p>

<p>“What you grinnin’ at?” demanded the storekeeper
sourly. “I s’pose you think it’s funny to
see men chased by a bull.”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I’m sorry you had to run.”</p>

<p>“Had to run? I didn’t have to run. I could a’
stood still, and fought that bull, if I’d a minded
to, but I had some money in my pocket, from collectin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
a bill, and I didn’t want to lose it. I wasn’t
afraid of that bull, and I don’t want you to git that
notion into your head, either.”</p>

<p>Dan thought it wisest to say nothing on this
score, though he was very certain Mr. Lee had
been very much frightened by the angry beast.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what it is,” went on the storekeeper,
“if you ever play a trick like that on me
again I’ll have you arrested, that’s what I’ll do.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a trick, Mr. Lee.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me. I know better. What do you
want?”</p>

<p>“I want a quarter’s worth of molasses.”</p>

<p>“Well, give me the jug.”</p>

<p>Dan handed it to the storekeeper who filled it
from a barrel in one corner of the store.</p>

<p>“Where’s the money?” demanded Mr. Lee. “I
ain’t goin’ to trust Peter Savage any more. He
owes me money now, an’ when I sue him for the
damage the bull done to me he’ll owe me more.
I’ve got to have cash for things, an’ you can tell
him so.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Mrs. Savage had anticipated that something
like this might come to pass, for, contrary to
her usual custom, she had given Dan the money to
pay for the molasses.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Here’s the quarter,” spoke the boy, tossing the
coin on the counter.</p>

<p>It fell with a curious, dull thud, and not with a
ring, such as silver gives out. Mr. Lee took up the
money, looked at it closely, threw it down on the
counter again to listen to the sound it made, and
then announced:</p>

<p>“Don’t try none of your tricks on me, Dan
Hardy.”</p>

<p>“Tricks? What do you mean? I’m not playing
any tricks.”</p>

<p>“Then what do you mean by giving me bad
money? That’s a counterfeit twenty-five cent piece,
an’ you knowed it.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know anything of the kind, and I
don’t believe it’s bad.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh? Listen to that sound!”</p>

<p>Again Mr. Lee rang the coin on the counter. It
gave forth a dull tinkle. Dan had to acknowledge
the coin did not have the right sound.</p>

<p>“I’m not goin’ to give molasses for bad money,”
went on Mr. Lee.</p>

<p>“I haven’t any other.”</p>

<p>“Then you will have to go back fer more. Made
me draw a gallon of molasses fer nothin’. I’ll keep
the jug until its paid for.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Mrs. Savage will be angry if I don’t bring her
back the molasses.”</p>

<p>“What do I care?”</p>

<p>“If you let me take the molasses back with me,
I’ll tell Mr. Savage that the money he gave me, or,
rather which Mrs. Savage gave me, was no good.
I’ll bring you another quarter as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>Dan determined to do the best he could to fulfill
his errand, even if it was not his fault that the
storekeeper would not trust the old farmer.</p>

<p>“Wa’ll, I s’pose that’ll have to do.”</p>

<p>The truth was Mr. Lee did not like to lose trade,
and, though Mr. Savage owed him quite a bill, he
knew he would be paid in time. If he did not accommodate
the farmer’s wife they might take their
trade elsewhere.</p>

<p>“You tell Peter Savage he’d better be careful
how he circulates counterfeit money,” went on Mr.
Lee, as he gave Dan back the quarter, and passed
over the jug of molasses. “An’ be sure an’ bring
me a good quarter as soon as ye kin.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Dan. “I wonder where that
bad money came from?” he thought as he started
for home.</p>

<p>Though he had done the errand in much less
time than usual, because of the ride Mr. Harrison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
had given him, Dan was scolded by Mrs. Savage
when he got in.</p>

<p>“I never see such a lazy boy!” she exclaimed.
“Did ye stop t’ make th’ molasses?”</p>

<p>“I came pretty near not getting it,” said Dan,
and he told her of the incident of the bad quarter.
As he had anticipated, that caused Mrs. Savage
more astonishment than did the reported refusal
of Mr. Lee to extend any more credit, for though
Mr. Savage was wealthy he delayed as long as he
could the paying of debts.</p>

<p>“That quarter bad!” she exclaimed, as Dan
handed it to her. “I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p>But when she tested it carefully she had to
admit that it was.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, of all things!” she cried. “That’s a
swindle, and I’ll have th’ law on that man!”</p>

<p>“Who gave it to Mr. Savage?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Who? Why that pesky book agent that was
askin’ ye so many questions. Pa—which was
what she called her husband—give it to me fer
grocery money. Now it’s bad! Wa’ll ye’ll have
t’ make it up, that’s all. It was your fault that we
got it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you can say that.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t, eh? well I say it, jest th’ same, an’ I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
tell ye what, ye’ve got t’ pay us back in some way.”</p>

<p>“What’s th’ matter?” inquired Mr. Savage,
coming in from the barn. “Hey, Dan! Ain’t ye
back at shellin’ corn yet? Land sakes! I never
see sech a lazy boy!”</p>

<p>“Look a-here!” exclaimed Mrs. Savage. “This
quarter’s a counterfeit,” and she quickly told the
story of it.</p>

<p>“Land o’ Tunket!” cried Mr. Savage. “I’ve
been swindled, that’s what I have. That was a slick
feller, what was talkin’ t’ ye that day, Dan. It’s
all your fault, too. Ef ye hadn’t been so ready t’
answer his questions he’d a gone on about his business,
an’ I wouldn’t be out a quarter. It’s all your
fault.”</p>

<p>As the quarter had been given for a few minutes
of Dan’s not very valuable time, it was hard to understand
where Mr. Lee was out of pocket. But,
like most unreasonable men, if he once believed a
thing, he seldom changed his mind.</p>

<p>“Shall I take a good quarter back to Mr. Lee?”
asked Dan. “I promised him I would.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I guess not. Ye’ve loafed enough fer
one day. I’ll take him a quarter when I git good
an’ ready. Now ye’d better start t’ weedin’ th’
onion patch. It needs it, an’ don’t be all day about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
it, nuther. Step lively, I never see sech a lazy
boy!”</p>

<p>Dan did not reply, but, as he went to the big
onion patch, which he hated almost as much as he
did the corn sheller, he could not help thinking of
the man who had given his employer the counterfeit
money.</p>

<p>“There’s something queer about that man,”
thought Dan. “He isn’t what he seems to be, a
book agent. I wonder if he can be a counterfeiter?”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />


<small>A TELEPHONE MESSAGE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> days after this, during which time Dan
had been kept very busy about the farm, and helping
Mrs. Savage with the housework, a neighbor
called to him as he was hoeing the potatoes in
the garden patch.</p>

<p>“Say, Dan, is Mr. Savage in the house?”</p>

<p>“I think so, sir; did you want to see him?”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly, but some one has just called
him up on my telephone, and they want to talk to
him. I don’t see why he doesn’t get a telephone
of his own. Too mean, I suppose. I had to leave
off fixing a set of harness and come running over
to tell him.”</p>

<p>“It’s too bad you had that trouble,” responded
Dan. “I will call him.”</p>

<p>Dan dropped his hoe and started for the house.</p>

<p>“Tell him to hurry,” advised the man. “Whoever
it is that’s calling him has to hold the wire,
and that costs money.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>“Mr. Savage will not like that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he doesn’t have to pay for the time.
The person who called him up has to foot the
bill.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell him to hurry so as to save all the
expense he can.”</p>

<p>“Very well, I’ll go back to my work.”</p>

<p>Dan found his employer trying to sew up a rip
in one of his shoes, for Mr. Savage hated to spend
money on anything, and repairing his own footwear
was one of the ways he endeavored to save.</p>

<p>“Some one wants to speak to you on the telephone,
Mr. Savage.”</p>

<p>“Telephone? What telephone?”</p>

<p>“The one in Mr. Lane’s house.”</p>

<p>“Want’s to speak to me on th’ telephone? I
wonder who it can be? Nobody would want to
telephone me.”</p>

<p>“You had better hurry,” advised Dan. “It costs
money to hold the wire.”</p>

<p>“Hold th’ wire? Costs money? Say, ef anybody
thinks I’m goin’ t’ waste money t’ talk over
one of them things, they’re mighty much mistaken.
I ain’t got no money t’ throw away on sech foolishness,”
and he was about to proceed with his
shoe mending.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>“No, no, it doesn’t cost you anything,” explained
Dan. “The person who called you up has to pay.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s different. Wa’al, I guess I might as
well go then,” and he leisurely laid aside the shoe,
the piece of leather and needle.</p>

<p>“I think you had better hurry,” said Dan respectfully.</p>

<p>“Hurry? What fer? Didn’t ye say th’ other
fellow was payin’ fer it? I ain’t got no call t’ hurry.
It don’t cost me nothin’, an’ ef folks calls me up
they has t’ wait till I git good an’ ready t’ answer.”</p>

<p>There was no use trying to combat such a mean
argument as Dan felt this to be, so he said nothing,
but went back to resume his hoeing, before Mr.
Savage would have a chance to scold him for being
lazy.</p>

<p>“I wish some one would call me up on the telephone,
and tell me they had a good job for me—somewhere
else besides on a farm,” thought Dan,
as he bent to his work. “I wonder how it seems to
talk over a wire. It must be queer.”</p>

<p>When he found out he did not have to pay for
the telephone message Mr. Savage proceeded
slowly down the road to Mr. Lane’s house.
Though he pretended he was not anxious, the old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
miserly farmer was, nevertheless, quite excited in
wondering who could want to talk to him.</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a message from th’ police, to say
that th’ feller what give me that bad quarter has
been arrested,” he murmured as he approached
the house. “I hope it is. I’d like t’ see him git
ten years. It was a mean trick t’ play on me.”</p>

<p>“You’d better hurry,” advised Mr. Lane, as he
saw Mr. Savage coming up the front walk. “The
party on the other end of the wire is getting impatient.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, folks what bothers me at my work has
t’ wait,” spoke up Mr. Savage, in rather a surly
tone, and he did not thank Mr. Lane for his trouble
in calling him to the telephone.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage took up the receiver, and fairly
shouted into the transmitter:</p>

<p>“Hello: Who be ye? What ye want?”</p>

<p>“Not so loud,” cautioned Mr. Lane. “They
can hear you better if you speak lower.”</p>

<p>But Mr. Savage paid no attention. However
he ceased to shout, as the person on the other end
of the wire was talking. The farmer listened intently.
Then he began to reply:</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said. “I s’pose I kin do it, but
it takes my time. Yes, ye can tell her I’ll send it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
Guess I’ll have t’ let Dan bring it over. I’ll send
him t’night so’s t’ save time.”</p>

<p>Then he hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>“No bad news, I hope?” asked Mrs. Lane politely.</p>

<p>“Yes, ’tis,” replied Mr. Savage. “My sister
Lucy, over t’ Pokesville, was took suddenly sick
this mornin’. That was her husband telephonin’ t’
me. Lucy wants a bottle of our old family pain-killer.
I ain’t got none in th’ house, nuther, an’
I’ve got t’ go t’ th’ village an’ git it. That’s goin’
t’ take a lot of time.”</p>

<p>“Is she very sick?”</p>

<p>“Pretty bad, I guess, th’ way her husband
talked,” but Mr. Savage did not seem to regard
this so much as he did the loss of his time.</p>

<p>“He didn’t say nothin’ about pay, nuther,” he
went on. “I’ve got t’ put out my money fer th’
medicine, an’ goodness knows when I’ll get it back.
Then I’ve got t’ let Dan Hardy take th’ medicine
over. Land sakes! But sickness is a dreadful
nuisance! I don’t see what wimen is allers gittin’
sick fer.”</p>

<p>“Probably she couldn’t help it,” said Mr. Lane,
who was indignant at the lack of feeling on the
part of Mr. Savage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>“Wa’al, mebby not. But it takes my time an’
money just th’ same. But I’ll make Dan travel
by night, so he won’t lose any time.”</p>

<p>“No, it would be too bad if he had a few hours
off,” said Mr. Lane in a sarcastic manner, which,
however, was lost on Mr. Savage.</p>

<p>“I’m—I’m much obliged fer callin’ me,” said
the old farmer as he started away. It seemed as
if it hurt him to say those words, so crusty was he.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re welcome,” replied Mr. Lane
coldly.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage found his wife much excited, waiting
for him to return and tell her about the message,
for she had learned from Dan where her
husband had gone.</p>

<p>“Has any one died an’ left ye money?” was her
first question.</p>

<p>“No sech luck,” replied Mr. Savage. “I’ve got
t’ spend money as ’tis.”</p>

<p>“Can’t ye send the medicine by express, collect?”
asked Mrs. Savage when her husband told
of his sister’s illness.</p>

<p>“Wish I could, but there ain’t no express that
goes that way. No, I’ve got t’ send Dan.”</p>

<p>Mr. Savage began his preparations to go to
the village after the old family pain-killer, a mixture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
that had been used by himself and his relatives
as far back as he could remember. It was
taken for almost every thing, as few people care to
call in a doctor every time they feel ill.</p>

<p>“You’ll have t’ go over t’ Pokeville t’night,
Dan,” said the farmer, as he was driving to the village,
and he explained the reason. “Ye kin go hoss
back, an’ that’ll be quicker,” he added.</p>

<p>“It will take nearly all night to go there and
return, Mr. Savage.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I can’t help it. Ye ought t’ be back
here by five o’clock, an’ ye kin git an hour’s sleep,
an’ start in t’ work. Boys don’t need much rest.”</p>

<p>“No, nor not much else, if you had your way,”
thought Dan. “Oh, I’ve a good notion to run
away, only I don’t know where to run to. I must
see Mr. Harrison, and ask his advice,” and, pondering
over his hard lot, Dan continued to hoe the
potatoes.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />


<small>A MIDNIGHT RIDE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Savage</span> took his time in going to the village,
and did not come back until after the dinner
hour.</p>

<p>“Did ye git th’ medicine?” asked Mrs. Savage
of her husband.</p>

<p>“Yep, an’ it cost a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Tell Dan t’ ask yer sister fer it ’fore he delivers
th’ bottle,” advised the farmer’s wife.</p>

<p>“I guess that would be a good way,” decided
Mr. Savage, brightening up. “I kin charge fer
my time, too. I’ll have him ask a dollar an’ a
half. That won’t be so bad,” and he rubbed his
hands in satisfaction over the idea.</p>

<p>It was getting dusk when Dan started away on
the back of the mare Bess. He had been obliged
to do all his chores before starting, for Mr. Savage
never thought of such a thing as omitting any
of the farm work for the sake of his sick sister.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>“Now don’t ride th’ mare t’ death,” cautioned
Mr. Savage as Dan rode out of the barn. “Ye’ve
got all night, an’ th’ trip’ll de ye good.”</p>

<p>Dan had his doubts about this, but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Mrs. Randall is very sick?” the
boy said to himself as he was going along the highway
toward Pokeville in the dusk. “If I had a
sister who was ill I wouldn’t wait until night to
send her medicine. Pokeville is so far away from
any stores and doctors she might die before help
could reach her. I wonder what time I’ll get
there? I don’t know the roads very well, and,
from what the hired men said, they don’t either.
Seems to me Mr. Savage could have driven over
this afternoon by daylight. But I suppose he did
not want to waste the time.”</p>

<p>Thus pondering, Dan rode on. It was quite lonesome,
for in the country, people do not travel after
dark unless they have to, and there was no occasion
for many to be out this evening.</p>

<p>Dan met a few farmers whom he knew, and
spoke to them, but, after a while, it got so dark he
could not distinguish faces, even had he passed any
one, which did not happen once he got well outside
of Hayden.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>The mare plodded on, Dan stopping now and
then to look at sign boards to make sure he was on
the right road. About ten o’clock he came to a
place where four highways met. He got off the
mare’s back and lighted matches to read what the
signs might have on them. In the uncertain light
he thought he read, “Pokeville three miles,” with
a finger pointing to the east.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s not so bad,” he murmured. “I
can do three miles in half an hour, and I may get
back home in time to sleep.”</p>

<p>He mounted the mare again, and started off at
a smart trot. He soon began to look for some
signs of a village, but after he had ridden nearly
an hour, and all there was to be seen was the dark
road, he began to have his doubts.</p>

<p>“I wonder if I am going the right direction?”
he asked himself. “Bess, don’t you know?”</p>

<p>The mare whinnied an answer, but what it was,
Dan, of course, could not tell.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep on until I come to a house,” he decided,
“and then I’ll ask my way.”</p>

<p>About ten minutes after this he came to a lonely
residence, standing beside the road. It was all
dark, and the boy disliked to knock and arouse the
inmates, but he felt it was a case of necessity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Dismounting, and taking care not to smash the bottle
of medicine in his coat pocket, he pounded on
the door. The persons inside must have been
sound sleepers, for it was nearly five minutes before
a window was raised, and a man, thrusting
his head out, asked:</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the matter? What do you want?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to trouble you,” said Dan, “but is
this the road to Pokeville?”</p>

<p>“Land sakes no!” exclaimed the man. “You’re
five miles out of your way. What’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“I am taking some medicine to a sick woman
over there, and I looked at a sign post some five
miles back. I thought it said Pokeville was in
this direction.”</p>

<p>“I see, you made the same mistake other persons
make. There’s a town called Hokeville,
which is on this road. Lots of people look at the
sign in a hurry, and think it says Pokeville.”</p>

<p>“I should think they’d make the letters big
enough so people could read them easily,” remarked
Dan.</p>

<p>“That’s what they ought to.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter? Is the house afire?” demanded
a woman sticking her head out beside that
of the man.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>“No, no, Mandy. Every time there’s any excitement
at night you think there’s a fire.”</p>

<p>“Well, the chimbley was on fire onct!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it isn’t now. This is a boy inquiring
his way to Pokeville. Some one is sick and he’s
taking her some medicine.”</p>

<p>“Who’s sick, boy?” asked the woman, determined
not to miss a chance to hear some news,
even if she had been awakened from sleep.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Randall.”</p>

<p>“What, not Lucy Randall, she that was a Savage?”</p>

<p>“She’s Mr. Savage’s sister.”</p>

<p>“Do tell! What’s the matter with her?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“If you’ll go back about a mile, an’ take the
first road you come to, an’ then go along that until
ye come to an’ old grist mill, an’ then take th’ first
turn to the left, an’ the second to the right after
that, ye’ll git on th’ right road to Pokeville,” said
the man.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I can’t remember all that,” replied
Dan.</p>

<p>The man repeated it for him, and at last the
boy thought he could find his way. He thanked
his informant and started off, the woman calling
after him:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>“Tell Lucy that Mandy Perkins, her that married
a Linton, was askin’ fer her.”</p>

<p>“I will,” promised Dan.</p>

<p>He hurried Bess along through the dark night,
and along the unfamiliar road. He got as far
as the grist mill, which he could dimly distinguish,
and then he was at a loss. He might have
taken the wrong road again, but, fortunately a
farmer unexpectedly came along and directed him.</p>

<p>It was past midnight when Dan rode into the
village of Pokeville. It seemed as if every one was
asleep as he trotted through the lonely main street.
Now and then a dog barked, or a rooster crowed,
but that was the only sign of life. Dan knew his
way now, for Mr. Savage had given him directions
how to find the house of Mrs. Randall. It
was close to one o’clock when the youth knocked
at the door. He expected to find the house lighted
up, since some one in it was ill.</p>

<p>“I wonder if she can be—worse or dead,” he
murmured. “It seems very quiet.”</p>

<p>Some one must have been up, however, for, a
few moments after his pounding on the front door
had awakened the echoes of the silent house, an upper
window was raised and a head thrust out.</p>

<p>“Everyone seems afraid to open their front
doors after dark,” thought the lad.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>“Well, what’s wanted?” asked a man’s voice.</p>

<p>“Here is the medicine from Mr. Savage.”</p>

<p>“Oh! All right. I’ll be right down,” and the
man drew in his head. A woman’s at once replaced
it.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I’m Dan Hardy. I work for Mr. Savage. He
sent me with the medicine for his sister.”</p>

<p>“I’m his sister, but a lot of good the medicine
will do me now. I’m all over my pain. What kept
you so long?”</p>

<p>“I lost my way in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That’s a fine excuse! More likely
you stopped to play. You ought to have been here
at nine o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I did not start until nearly seven, madam.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. You were so long that my pain
all went away, and I don’t need the medicine now.
You’re a lazy boy, Dan Hardy, my brother says
so! The idea of keeping me suffering while you
loitered on the road.”</p>

<p>“I did not loiter. I came as quickly as I could.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you. You did it on purpose to
make me suffer. I’ll tell my brother.”</p>

<p>By this time the man had opened the door, and
had taken the bottle of medicine.</p>

<p>“Mr. Savage says it will be a dollar and a half,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
said Dan, giving the message he had been instructed
to deliver.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired Mrs. Randall from
above. “A dollar and a half? You can take it
right back again. I’ll never pay a dollar and a
half for medicine, and you can tell my brother so.
Give it right back to him, Sam, I insist on it.”</p>

<p>The man did not seem to know what to do, but
stood holding the medicine in one hand, and a lamp
in the other.</p>

<p>“Do you hear?” called Mrs. Randall. “Give
it right back to that lazy boy, and he can take it
home again. If it had come in time to do me any
good I’d a kept it, but I won’t now. My pain is
all gone, and I’m not going to waste a dollar and
a half. Give it back, I say.”</p>

<p>Looking rather ashamed the man handed the
bottle to Dan.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll have to take it back,” he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />


<small>THE MYSTERIOUS MEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was no help for it. Dan could not make
the Randalls take the medicine, though he knew
when he got back to Mr. Savage, he would be
blamed for their failure to keep it.</p>

<p>“Come on in and shut the door, Sam,” commanded
the woman sharply. “First thing you
know you’ll catch cold, and then you’ll have to take
medicine.”</p>

<p>“If he does I hope I don’t have to bring it,”
thought Dan.</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Mr. Randall, as he closed
the door and locked it. Overhead Mrs. Randall
slammed down the window.</p>

<p>“And they didn’t even say thank you,” mused
Dan as he put the bottle into his pocket and
mounted Bess.</p>

<p>Certainly it was a very mean way to treat him,
for he had done his best. He was glad that Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
Randall had recovered, but he knew Mr. Savage
would think less of that than the fact that he had
spent a dollar for medicine, and was not likely to
get it back.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’ll keep the bottle for himself,”
thought Dan. “In that case he’ll not be so angry
at me for bringing it back.” But this was a remote
possibility.</p>

<p>The only consolation the boy had was that he
had done his best. That he was late was no fault
of his, for any one might have been deceived about
the roads.</p>

<p>Tired and hungry, for the ride gave him a
hearty appetite, Dan started back. He thought his
employer’s sister might at least have asked him to
come in after his long journey, and have given him
something to eat. But Mrs. Randall was not that
kind of a person. Her husband was a goodhearted
man, but his wife ruled him, and he was
somewhat afraid of her.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t believe I’ll get lost going back,
anyhow,” thought the boy. “That’s one comfort.”</p>

<p>Dan rode on for several miles. He passed
through the town of Marsden, and knew he was
within about an hour’s ride of home. It was still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
very dark, and the sky was overcast with clouds.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll get a chance to sleep before I have
to do the chores,” the lad reasoned. “Maybe I’ll
stay out in the barn after I put Bess up. I can
snuggle down in the hay, and I’ll not disturb Mr.
Savage. I’d never get any sleep if I told him his
sister wouldn’t take the medicine.”</p>

<p>Deciding on this plan Dan called to Bess to
quicken her pace. As he went around a turn in the
road, the soft dust deadening the hoof-beats of the
mare, the boy saw a mass of dark shadows just
ahead of him.</p>

<p>“Looks like a wagon,” he decided. “Probably
some farmer around here making an early start for
market.”</p>

<p>Bess settled into a slow walk, for the mare was
tired, and Dan did not urge her. Just then the
moon, which had risen late, shone dimly through
a rift in the clouds. Dan was in the shadow cast
by some willow trees, and he could see quite plainly
now, that there were several men and a wagon,
just ahead of him.</p>

<p>The wagon stood in the middle of the road,
which at that point, was lined with woods on either
side.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/p072.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption">“THEY’RE HIDING STUFF,” DAN REASONED.—<i>Page <a href="#Page_73">73</a>.</i></p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>“Maybe they’ve had a break-down,” said Dan
to himself. “Perhaps I might be able to help
them.”</p>

<p>He was about to ride forward when he saw one
of the men take a bundle from the wagon, run
across the road with it, and disappear in the woods.</p>

<p>“That’s funny,” thought the boy. “What can
he be doing?”</p>

<p>A moment later another man did the same thing,
carrying what seemed to be a heavy bundle. A
third man remained on the wagon.</p>

<p>Dan saw that by keeping on one side of the road
he would be in the shadow and could remain hidden
until quite close to the mysterious men. Softly
he urged Bess forward, the horse making no
sound.</p>

<p>Once more he saw the men approach the wagon,
take something out, and disappear in the woods
with it.</p>

<p>“They’re hiding stuff,” Dan reasoned. “I wonder
if they’re chicken thieves?”</p>

<p>Several henhouses had been robbed of late in
the vicinity of Hayden, and Dan was on the alert.</p>

<p>“If it was hens they had,” he went on, “I could
hear some noise made by the fowls cackling or
flapping their wings. Whatever they have doesn’t
make any noise.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>For perhaps the fourth time the mysterious men
made a trip from the wagon into the woods. When
the two returned the man on the wagon seat inquired:</p>

<p>“Well, got it all planted?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and planted good and deep,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Come on then,” and the two who had carried
the bundles got into the wagon, the horse being
whipped to a gallop at once.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s queer,” decided Dan, as he saw the
wagon vanish amid the shadows. “They were
planting stuff, but what sort of stuff would they
plant at night, and where could they plant it in the
woods? There’s something queer back of this. I
wish I could find out what it was, but I can’t stop
now, or I’ll not get back to the farm before sunrise.”</p>

<p>He looked to make sure none of the men remained
behind, and then he rode up to where the
wagon had halted. There were visible in the dust
by the dim moonlight, the marks of many feet,
and the bushes on one side of the road were
trampled down, showing where the men had entered
the woods.</p>

<p>A gleam of something shining in the dust attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Dan’s attention. He got off the mare and
picked it up.</p>

<p>“A silver spoon!” he exclaimed as he examined
it. “Perhaps those fellows were silverware peddlers
and were hiding their stock in trade until they
could come for it. Well, it doesn’t concern me,
and I guess I’d better be going. I’ll keep this spoon
for a souvenir.”</p>

<p>He thrust it into his pocket, jumped on the back
of Bess, and was off down the road. He kept a
lookout for the wagon containing the men, but it
seemed to have turned off down a side road.</p>

<p>Dan reached the farm just as it was getting
dawn. He put the mare in her stall, after watering
and feeding her, and then crawled up into the
hay-mow, hoping to get a little sleep before it
would be time to start on his day’s work.</p>

<p>He must have slept quite soundly, for the sun
was shining into the barn when he was awakened
by hearing Mr. Savage exclaim:</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I wonder what keeps that lazy boy?”
Then the farmer caught sight of the mare in her
stall. “Why, he’s back! I wonder where’s he hidin’?
Loafin’ again, that’s what he is!”</p>

<p>“Here I am, Mr. Savage,” spoke Dan, sliding
down from the pile of hay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>“What in th’ name a’ Tunket be ye doin’ thar?”</p>

<p>“I did not want to disturb you by coming into
the house, so I slept out here.”</p>

<p>“Thought ye’d git a longer chance t’ lay abed, I
s’pose. Did ye git th’ dollar an’ a half?”</p>

<p>Mr. Savage thought more of the money than he
did of the condition of his sister, as was evidenced
by his question.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t get it,” answered Dan.</p>

<p>“Ye don’t mean t’ say ye lost it? Lost a dollar
an’ a half! If ye have—”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t give it to me. She did not need
the medicine, as she was better.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t want th’ medicine, after I bought it fer
her? Why, good land a’ Tunket: She has t’ take
it!”</p>

<p>“She said it came too late.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s your fault, Dan Hardy! Ye loitered
on th’ road, until my sister got better. Now I’m
out a dollar an’ a half through you! I’ll make ye
pay—”</p>

<p>Then Mr. Hardy seemed to remember that Dan
never had any money, and could not pay for the
medicine.</p>

<p>“I’ll—I’ll get it outer ye somehow,” he threatened.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
“Th’ idea of wastin’ time, an’ makin’ me
throw away a dollar an’ a half!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you keep the medicine until you or Mrs.
Savage need it?” asked Dan, trying to see a way
out of the difficulty.</p>

<p>“Keep it? Why I might have it in th’ house
six months an’ never need it. I ain’t never sick,
an’ there is my money all tied up in a bottle of
medicine. It’s a shame, that’s what ’tis! Wimmin
folks hadn’t oughter git sick! Now ye’d better
git t’ work. Them onions need weedin’ agin.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t had my breakfast, Mr. Savage.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, ye don’t deserve any, but I s’pose ye got
t’ have it. Go int’ th’ house, but hustle.”</p>

<p>The boy, who resented this way of being talked
to, started for the kitchen, where he knew he was
likely to meet sour words and angry looks from
Mrs. Savage.</p>

<p>“I s’pose I’d better put this bottle away where
it won’t git busted,” murmured Mr. Savage, as he
followed Dan. “I’m goin’ t’ write t’ Lucy, an’ see
if I can’t make her pay me fer half of it anyhow.”</p>

<p>Dan thought his employer would have hard
work making Mrs. Randall pay.</p>

<p>As the boy and the farmer were crossing the
road to the house, they saw a man coming along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
the highway, riding a horse, which he was urging
to a gallop.</p>

<p>“That’s Dr. Maxwell’s hired man,” observed
Mr. Savage. “I wonder what’s the matter?”</p>

<p>The man was opposite them now.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Silas?” called Mr. Savage.</p>

<p>“Burglars!” exclaimed Silas. “Dr. Maxwell’s
house was robbed last night, an’ all the silverware
stolen! I’m goin’ t’ th’ village after th’ constables!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />


<small>HANK LEE’S INFORMATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment the news came as such a shock to
Dan and Mr. Savage that they did not know what
to say. Robberies in the country are few and far
between, consequently they create more excitement
than they do in the city.</p>

<p>“Dr. Maxwell’s house robbed!” repeated Mr.
Savage.</p>

<p>“Yep,” replied Silas Martin, the hired man,
who also drove the physician on his sick calls.
Silas pulled up his horse. It was the first chance
he had had to tell the news, and he was not going
to miss it, even if the doctor had told him to hurry.</p>

<p>“When did they discover it?” inquired Dan.</p>

<p>“This mornin’, I found it out. I was up early,
’cause the doctor has t’ make a long trip this mornin’
an’ I see th’ dinin’ room winder up a bit. I
knowed it was locked last night, an’ I got suspicious.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>“I should think ye would,” commented Mr.
Savage.</p>

<p>“Yep, I was,” went on Silas, evidently very
proud of what he had done. “I seen th’ winder
was up, an’ I was suspicious. I looked around an’
I seen all th’ silverware was gone!”</p>

<p>“Land sakes! Do tell!” exclaimed Mrs. Savage,
who had left her morning’s work, on
seeing Silas stop, and had come out to hear the
news.</p>

<p>“Every bit,” went on the hired man. “Then I
yelled, an’ th’ doctor an’ his wife come down stairs.
Some of their jewelery was gone, too. I tell ye
them thieves got most a thousand dollars’ wuth of
stuff!”</p>

<p>“And they got in through the dining room window,”
remarked Dan.</p>

<p>“How’d ye know?” asked Silas quickly.</p>

<p>“Didn’t you say it was open?”</p>

<p>“That’s so. I did. Yep, them thieves pried it
up with some kind of a crowbar, or a big screwdriver,
or maybe a tack lifter. Ye could see th’
marks on the sill. They broke the catch.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t ye hear any sound in th’ night?” asked
Mrs. Savage.</p>

<p>“I didn’t” replied Silas, “but then I’m a turrible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
heavy sleeper. I guess th’ doctor didn’t nuther,
fer he didn’t say nothin’ about it.”</p>

<p>“Were any suspicious characters seen around?”
asked Dan, as he suddenly thought of something.</p>

<p>“Not as I know of. But I’ve got to git along
an’ tell th’ constables. Th’ doctor told me t’ hurry
He tried t’ git ’em on th’ telephone, but I guess
there ain’t nobody up at th’ town hall yit, fer they
didn’t answer.”</p>

<p>“What all did ye say was stole?” asked Mrs.
Savage, for she had missed part of the recital.</p>

<p>“I’ll stop and tell ye on my way back,” called
Silas, as he urged the horse to a gallop.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, of all things!” remarked Mr. Savage,
as the hired man rode away. “Fust thing we know
we’ll all be murdered in our beds.”</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! Don’t talk that way, Peter,” begged
his wife, who was very nervous. “What’s that
package?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s th’ medicine Lucy wouldn’t take,”
and Mr. Savage, who had momentarily forgotten
all about the pain-killer, told Mrs. Savage of Dan’s
trip. The two were so indignant over the outcome,
partly blaming the boy for taking the wrong
road, and partly blaming Mr. Savage’s sister, that
they took little notice of Dan, who hurried into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
house and got his breakfast, rather a slim one,
which was being kept warm on the stove.</p>

<p>Then, wishing to be alone, to get a chance to
think, Dan took his hoe and went to a distant cornfield
to work.</p>

<p>“I wonder if those queer men I saw, who were
hiding something in the woods, weren’t the ones
who robbed Dr. Maxwell’s house?” thought Dan.
“They certainly acted very suspiciously. I believe
they were. I wonder what I had better do?”</p>

<p>He pondered over it until he got to the end of a
long row.</p>

<p>“I suppose I had better tell Mr. Savage,” he
went on. “Yet, if I do, he’ll say I was loitering
along the road. Perhaps I’d better go into the
village, and inform the constables. They at least,
would be glad of the information, but I don’t believe
Mr. Savage would even thank me.”</p>

<p>Once more Dan indulged in some hard thinking.</p>

<p>“I suppose I could tell Dr. Maxwell,” he went
on to himself, “but it’s farther to go to his house
than it is to the village. I guess I’d better tell the
constables, and not bother Mr. Savage. That’s
what I’ll do. As soon as I get a chance I’ll slip
into the village. But I must finish hoeing this corn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
or I’ll be in for another lecture on my lazy habits.”</p>

<p>In the meantime Silas Martin had proceeded to
the village to inform the authorities of the robbery.
There were no police in Hayden. Instead
their place was taken by two rather elderly constables,
Jacob Wolff and Frederick Walker. They
both thought themselves as good as any regular
police that ever wore brass buttons, and Mr. Wolff,
in particular, imagined he was quite a detective.</p>

<p>Silas found the two constables in Hank Lee’s
store, which they used as a sort of headquarters,
since the town hall was rather lonesome, few persons
calling there. At the store the constables
could be sure of meeting many friends and hearing
all the news there was.</p>

<p>“Come on, quick! Out t’ Dr. Maxwell’s,” Silas
called to the officers.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter. Has he been murdered?”
asked Jacob Wolff who was always on the lookout
for big sensations.</p>

<p>“No, but he’s been robbed. He wants you t’
come right away.”</p>

<p>“I s’pose he wants me t’ arrest th’ robber,” said
Frederick Walker. “I’ll do it right off. I can do
it alone, Jake,” addressing his companion. “Ye
needn’t come. Guess I’m a match fer any robber.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
I’ve got my badge an’ my revolver,” and he looked
at the big nickel-plated star on his breast, and
pulled out an old horse pistol.</p>

<p>“There ain’t no robber t’ arrest,” spoke Silas
with a grin. “He got away, an’ took all th’ doctor’s
silver with him.”</p>

<p>“Got away, eh?” exclaimed Jacob Wolff. “Then
it’s a mystery. It’s me they want, Fred, not you.
Th’ doctor has heard of my detective abilities.
Are there any clues?” he asked of Silas.</p>

<p>“Clues? What’s them?”</p>

<p>“Did the robbers leave anything behind so’s I
could identify ’em?”</p>

<p>“You mean did they leave their names an’ addresses?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not! Who ever heard of robbers
doin’ that? I mean did they leave any marks,
footprints, or anything belonging to ’em?”</p>

<p>“They left some marks of a screwdriver or
suthin’ on th’ winder sill, where they pried th’ winder
up,” replied Silas.</p>

<p>“Nothing else?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, th’ doctor found a strange handkerchief
under th’ winder.”</p>

<p>“That a clue!” exclaimed Jacob Wolff eagerly.
“That’s a clue! I’ll go right out, an’ look at it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>“I don’t see what good it’ll do,” observed Silas.
“It’s jest a plain handkerchief, with nothin’ on it.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind,” declared Constable Wolff.
“Real detectives can see clues where other folks
can’t see nothin’. I’ll have a look at that clue.”</p>

<p>“An’ I’ll go along an’ arrest th’ robber when ye
find him,” volunteered his companion. “I reckon
between us both, Jake, we’ll be able t’ land him behind
th’ bars.”</p>

<p>“Wait until I see that clue,” said Constable
Wolff, with a mysterious air.</p>

<p>“Guess you won’t need much of a clue to tell
who robbed the doctor’s house,” suddenly remarked
Hank Lee, who had been listening to the
talk.</p>

<p>“Not need any clues? Of course I need clues,”
replied Constable Wolff.</p>

<p>“Not to my way of thinking.”</p>

<p>“Why not? Do you mean t’ say ye know who
the robber was?”</p>

<p>“Well, I can come pretty near guessing. If you
was to ask Dan Hardy what he was doing out all
night last night an’ what he has in a bundle that
he took such care of, an’ why he was riding horse
back before sun-up this morning, I reckon he’d be
some embarrassed to answer you,” went on Hank.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>“Do you mean Dan robbed that house?” asked
Constable Walker, while Silas and Jacob looked
astonished.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not going to make any charge, for
it might get me into trouble, and he’d sue me. But
I’ll tell what I know about it. I got up quite early
this morning because I had the toothache, and I
wanted something to stop it. I got some toothache
drops, and when I finished using ’em, I looked
out of the window and I see some one riding by on
a horse. I knowed in a minute who it was, ’cause
I know Peter Savage’s mare, Bess, as well as I
know my own critters. I see it was Dan on her,
and he had some sort of a package in his pocket.
It was quite a big package, too, and he was taking
good care of it. Maybe if you was to ask him,
he’d tell you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet it was the stolen silver, and he was hidin’
it!” exclaimed Constable Walker. “Come on,
Jake, we’ll arrest him before he can skip out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t seem very likely Dan Hardy would be
a robber,” remarked Jacob. “I’ve knowed him
quite a while, an’ he’s always been honest. His
father was a good man, and his mother used to
teach in th’ Sunday School.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t saying Dan takes after them,” interposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
Hank Lee. “I’m not making any charges,
understand, but I’m telling you what I saw.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he done it,” ventured the doctor’s
hired man.</p>

<p>“Ye don’t know nothin’ about it,” declared Constable
Walker. “I believe he’s guilty, an’ I’m
goin’ t’ arrest him ’fore he escapes. Ye needn’t
come unless ye want t’, Jake.”</p>

<p>But Constable Wolff was not going to let his
companion get the glory of the arrest alone, and
together they started for the farm to take Dan
into custody.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />


<small>DAN’S ARREST</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as Dan had made up his mind what
he was going to do,—that is go to the village and
tell the constables what he had seen that night,—he
hurried with his corn hoeing.</p>

<p>“I think I’ll change my clothes before I go,” he
said to himself. “These aren’t fit to go to town in.
My others are not much better, but they haven’t
quite so many holes.”</p>

<p>Dan had to wear second-hand clothes, or garments
made over from those cast aside by his employer,
for Mrs. Savage was determined not to
spend any money on the lad.</p>

<p>“I think my best plan will be to get into the
house quietly,” thought Dan, “for if Mr. Savage
sees me he’ll not let me go.”</p>

<p>He knew a way he could get to his room without
being seen by any one in the house. This was
to go up through the back orchard, and climb an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
old apple tree, one branch of which was opposite
the window of his garret room.</p>

<p>Once in his apartment he could change his
clothes and leave his room the same way, slipping
off to the village. He did not feel it would be
wrong to do so, as he had worked considerable
over-time of late, and was entitled to a few hours
off. Besides, he was doing the doctor a service.</p>

<p>Dan managed to reach his room without attracting
any attention from Mrs. Savage, who was doing
her baking. Once in his sleeping apartment
Dan gathered up his clothes.</p>

<p>“Guess I’ll not change here,” he said to himself.
“It might take too long, and she might come
up and find me. I’ll make a bundle, and do my
changing in the barn.”</p>

<p>Accordingly he did up his other suit, shoes and
a clean collar in a little package, tied it to his back,
and prepared to descend by means of the old apple
tree.</p>

<p>“I certainly hope I can put the constables on the
right track,” he mused. “If I could, and the robbers
were arrested, maybe I would get a reward.
That would be fine. I’d have some money of my
own, then, and perhaps I could get a better place,
where I could go to school, or, at least, do some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
studying.” Which showed that Dan was an ambitious
lad, and wanted to rise in life.</p>

<p>Making sure that his bundle would not slip out
of the cord, he stepped from his window sill, and
out on the big limb. He was about to descend
when he heard some one talking, and looking
down, he saw four men close to the tree.</p>

<p>The men were the two constables, one of Mr.
Savage’s hired men and Silas Martin, who had accompanied
the officers back to the farm. They
had arrived a little while before, and had sought
out Mr. Savage to tell him their errand, but
learned that the old farmer had gone to a distant
meadow, to repair a fence.</p>

<p>“Could I attend to matters fer you?” Mrs. Savage
had asked, pausing in the midst of her baking.
She hoped the three men would tell her their errand,
as she was very curious. She rather suspected
it had to do with the robbery, and imagining
they were organizing a crowd to hunt down
the burglars, wanted her husband to help.</p>

<p>“No, ma’am, we’ll explain to Mr. Savage,” had
been the reply from Constable Wolff, who had
taken upon himself the part of spokesman.
“Never tell any detective news to a woman,” he
cautioned his companions a little later. “They
can’t keep a secret.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>The two constables whispered together for a
moment, and then announced that they would go
to the barn and await the return of Mr. Savage.
That was one object they had, and the other was
due to a suggestion of Constable Wolff’s, that they
try to locate the whereabouts of Dan, and prevent
him escaping, until they could consult with his employer.
The truth was, in spite of what Hank Lee
had said, both constables were a little doubtful of
Dan’s guilt.</p>

<p>When the officers and Silas reached the barn
they met one of the hired men. Making a casual
inquiry from him, Mr. Wolff learned that the
farm-hand had seen Dan leave the cornfield some
time before and start for the house.</p>

<p>“Then he’s tryin’ to escape!” Constable Wolff
had declared. “That’s his object! Come on, we’ll
surround the house. I’ll appoint you a special deputy,”
he added to the hired man, “an’ you’ll be
obliged by law to help us.”</p>

<p>“Help you do what?”</p>

<p>“Arrest Dan Hardy.”</p>

<p>“Arrest Dan Hardy? What for?”</p>

<p>“We suspect him of the robbery of Dr. Maxwell’s
house. Mind you, we only suspect him,
an’ we want to question him. You’ve got t’ help.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll help you, all right, but you needn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
worry. Dan Hardy is as innocent as I am. He
isn’t going to run away. Come on, I’ll take you to
his room.”</p>

<p>“No, no. We must go cautiously,” objected
Constable Wolff, his detective abilities asserting
themselves. “If we go to th’ front of th’ house, he
may see us, an’ get out th’ back way. First we’ll
go t’ th’ back, an’ I’ll post you there as a guard.
Then Fred, Silas an’ me, we’ll go in an’ get him.”</p>

<p>“Suit yourselves,” answered the hired man, who
was a good friend of Dan’s. “He’ll not be afraid
to answer your questions, and he’ll not try to run
away.”</p>

<p>Now my readers can understand how it was that
the four men happened to be under the tree just as
Dan was coming down. The two officers and Silas
had been led there by the hired man, who offered
to point out the window of Dan’s room.</p>

<p>“You stay here, keep guard, an’ we’ll go around
front,” directed Constable Wolff.</p>

<p>At that instant Dan started to descend to the
ground. He made quite a commotion among the
leaves, and the men, hearing it, looked up. Constable
Walker caught sight of the boy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>“Dan Hardy, we want you!” called Mr. Wolff
sternly. “Don’t try to hide away from us. We see
you!”</p>

<p>“I’m not hiding,” replied Dan.</p>

<p>“Then what are you doing up that tree?”</p>

<p>“I’m coming down from my room,” for Dan
did not want to explain all of his reasons for his
actions.</p>

<p>“That’s a queer answer,” commented the constable.
“Where ye goin’?”</p>

<p>“I was just going to see you.”</p>

<p>“Humph, that’s a likely story! Guess you
knowed I was comin’ after you.”</p>

<p>“No, I did not,” replied Dan, “but I was going
to tell you about the robbery—at least what I
know.”</p>

<p>“He’s goin’ to confess!” whispered Constable
Walker. “I guess he knowed I was after him.”</p>

<p>“You’d better come down,” advised Constable
Wolff.</p>

<p>“I’m going to.”</p>

<p>As Dan slid to the ground the bundle he had
tied to his back slipped from the string. The package
struck the hard earth and burst open, revealing
his clothes, shoes and clean collar.</p>

<p>“Ha! I knowed it!” cried Jacob Wolff. “We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
come jest in time! He was all packed up ready to
escape! Dan Hardy, I arrest you in th’ name of
th’ law!” and he grasped the boy by the collar of
his coat.</p>

<p>“Arrest me? What for?” and poor Dan became
quite alarmed.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know what for, you jest confessed it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t ye jest say ye was comin’ t’ tell us about
th’ robbery?” demanded Mr. Walker.</p>

<p>“Yes, but—”</p>

<p>“Then I arrest ye fer the burglarizin’ of Dr.
Maxwell’s house last night!” cried Constable
Walker, also seizing Dan by the coat, determined
not to be outdone by his companion.</p>

<p>“Tell ’em you didn’t do it, Dan!” exclaimed the
hired man. “I know you didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the boy, touched by these
friendly words. “Of course I did not commit the
robbery, though I may be able to tell you something
about it.”</p>

<p>“I guess ye kin; more than’s good fer ye,” and
Constable Walker laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p>“You should warn him that anything he says
may be used against him,” declared the hired man.
“That’s the law, and you know it. You have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
right to trap him into saying something that may
incriminate him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right,” admitted Mr. Wolff. “It’s
my lawful duty,” he went on, “to state that anythin’
ye say will be used for trial. So ye’d better
keep still, ’less you want to tell,” he added cunningly.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to conceal,” said Dan. “I can
easily prove that I was some miles away from here
at the time of the robbery. If Mr. Savage was
here he would tell you. As I said before, I may
know something that will be of service to the authorities.
I saw some strange men last night, and
their actions puzzled me. I was on my way to tell
you, and—”</p>

<p>“Yes, ye was goin’ t’ tell us, but we find ye
hidin’ in a tree, with yer clothes all packed up
ready t’ run away,” interposed Constable Walker.
“That’s a likely yarn! Ye kin tell that t’ th’
Squire. I believe ye robbed th’ house, an’ I’m goin’
t’ search ye.”</p>

<p>Things began to look bad for poor Dan. It
was easy to see how his actions were misconstrued.
Even the simple packing up of some of his clothes
made it look as if he was going to run away.</p>

<p>At the mention of the word “search” Dan drew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
back indignantly. He was not used to such treatment.
Before he could prevent it the constable
had thrust his hand into the boy’s pocket. As he
did so he uttered an exclamation. Then he drew
forth a silver spoon. It was the one Dan had
picked up in the road, near where he had seen the
mysterious men.</p>

<p>“What ye got there?” asked Constable Wolff,
who wished he had done the searching.</p>

<p>“A silver spoon,” was the answer. “I’ll bet it’s
part of the stolen booty. Yep,” he went on, “it’s
got an ‘M’ on it, an’ M stands fer Maxwell.
Now, Dan Hardy, I guess ye can’t say ye’re innocent!
We’ve found part of th’ stolen property on
ye. Come along now.”</p>

<p>Poor Dan, who had forgotten all about the
spoon, felt his heart sink like lead. He was arrested
for theft.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />


<small>TAKEN TO JAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Even</span> the hired man, good friend as he was to
Dan, could not but admit that matters looked black
for the boy. Dan had been away all night, and,
though those at Mr. Savage’s farm knew where he
had been sent, they could not give evidence that
he had not gone to Dr. Maxwell’s house, as well
as to the Randall place. Getting on the wrong
road, and being delayed, had operated against
Dan.</p>

<p>“Have you got to take me with you?” he asked
of the constables.</p>

<p>“’Course we’re goin’ t’ take ye with us,” replied
Mr. Walker. “Think we’re goin’ t’ all this
trouble catchin’ a robber, an’ then let him go? Not
much!”</p>

<p>“But where is Mr. Savage? He can prove that
I was gone all night, taking a bottle of medicine to
his sister.”</p>

<p>“He’s not here now, an’ no matter what he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
we’d have t’ take ye, after all th’ evidence we’ve
discovered,” replied Constable Wolff.</p>

<p>“You had better say nothing more, Dan,” advised
the hired man. “Go with the constables. I
will tell Mr. Savage what has happened, as soon
as he comes back, and I think he will testify in your
favor. I’ll come to the village as soon as I can.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find him in th’ jail,” called Mr. Wolff,
as he moved away, with his hands tightly clenched
in Dan’s collar.</p>

<p>“In jail! Oh, you’re not going to put me in jail,
are you?” pleaded the unfortunate boy.</p>

<p>“’Course we are. That’s where all prisoners
has t’ go, an’ ye ain’t any better than any one else.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” admitted Dan, trying hard not to
let the hot tears come into his eyes, “but I am innocent
of this charge.”</p>

<p>“Then ye can tell th’ Squire so, an’ he’ll let ye
go,” spoke Mr. Walker.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” asked Mrs. Savage, who,
unable to restrain her curiosity any longer, had
come out to see where the constables were. “What
has Dan done?”</p>

<p>“He’s arrested fer robbin’ Dr. Maxwell’s
house,” declared Constable Walker.</p>

<p>“For robbery! Oh, I allers knowed he’d come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
t’ some bad end,” and the woman shook her head,
as if this was what she had always expected.</p>

<p>“Do you believe I did it, Mrs. Savage?” asked
Dan.</p>

<p>“I ain’t got nothin’ to say,” replied the woman.
“I don’t know nothin’ about law business. I’m not
goin’ t’ be a witness in th’ police court.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe ye done it, Dan,” put in Silas
Martin, who had been too astonished at the sudden
turn of events to say anything up to this time.
“Them was professional burglars what done th’
job. I’ll tell Dr. Maxwell, and he’ll come t’ see ye.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Silas,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Huh! I s’pose ye think, ’cause ye discovered it,
that ye know all about th’ robbery,” sneered Mr.
Wolff. “Let me tell ye it takes a detective t’ decide
whether a job was done by professional robbers
or not. I’ll take a look at th’ house soon as
I’ve got my prisoner safe behind th’ bars.”</p>

<p>“Are you—are you going t’ lock me up?” asked
Dan, his heart fluttering in fear and shame.</p>

<p>“Of course. I’m not goin’ t’ take any chances on
ye’re escapin’, like ye most done. I’ve got ye, an’
I’m goin’ t’ keep ye,” and Constable Walker, who
made this heartless speech, nodded his head vigorously,
in which he was imitated by his companion.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>“I thought maybe you could let me stay in the
town hall without locking me up,” went on Dan.
“Mr. Savage will surely be able to prove that I was
far away when this robbery occurred. Until then,
why need you lock me up? It will only be a little
while.”</p>

<p>“We ain’t takin’ no chances,” declared Constable
Wolff. “Come on now,” and he started to lead
Dan away.</p>

<p>“You’d better go in a wagon,” interposed the
hired man. “I’ll hitch up for you.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea,” declared Mr. Wolff. “He
might escape if we walked with him.”</p>

<p>“Ef ye take one of our hosses or wagons ye’ll
have t’ pay fer it,” warned Mrs. Savage.</p>

<p>“We will,” replied Mr. Walker. “Ye kin send
yer bill t’ th’ county. They allow th’ use of a rig
in bringin’ prisoners from a distance.”</p>

<p>Hanging his head in shame at the disgrace that
had come to him, just at the time when he thought
he was serving the ends of justice, poor Dan got
into the wagon, between his captors, the hot tears
coming into his eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll come to you, or send Mr. Savage as soon as
he gets back,” promised the hired man, but Dan
felt that he would receive little consolation from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
his mean employer, though the farmer could not
refuse to testify in his favor.</p>

<p>“And I’ll tell Dr. Maxwell,” added Silas Martin,
as he rode back to the house that had been
robbed.</p>

<p>There was great excitement in the village when
the two constables drove in, with Dan seated between
them. The news of the robbery had spread
like wildfire, and, to the eager inquiries that were
met with on every side, the two officials told of
Dan’s arrest.</p>

<p>“There he is! There’s the robber!” he could
hear persons in the crowd exclaim. Most of the
villagers knew him, and curious as it may seem,
there were few who did not believe him guilty,
though they had always up to this time, been certain
he was an honest boy. Very often, when a man
or a boy is in misfortune, many take pleasure in
adding to it by harsh words.</p>

<p>The crowd increased as word of Dan’s arrest
spread. At first he hung his head, and pulled his
cap down over his eyes, but, though he was much
ashamed of his plight, he knew he was innocent,
and he determined to hold up his head and look
every one in the face.</p>

<p>Even this action was not regarded rightly by
most of the curious ones.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>“Oh, see how bold he is!” exclaimed a gossiping
woman, whom Mrs. Hardy in her life time, had
often befriended. “He brazens it right out. But
them Hardy folks was always uppish, and considered
themselves too good to associate with common
folks. I wonder what Dan’s relations would say,
if they saw him now.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he has any,” replied another
woman. “He is all alone in the world.”</p>

<p>At length the wagon came to a stop in front of
the town hall, part of which was finished off into
two cells, that made up the jail of Hayden. There
were not often prisoners in the cells, as crime was
rather infrequent in the village.</p>

<p>In spite of the shame and disgrace of it, Dan
was rather glad to be taken into the building, as
he hoped to escape the curious throng, many persons
in which were making unkind remarks about
him.</p>

<p>But in this he was doomed to disappointment.
Quite a crowd followed the constables, for an arrest
was a novelty in Hayden, especially one involving
a village character, and on such a serious
charge as this.</p>

<p>“Now then, you people have all got t’ git back!”
ordered Constable Wolff.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>“Guess this is a public place, and we’ve got a
right here,” said some one.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, maybe ye have, at th’ trial. But ye
can’t come in th’ jail, ’less ye want t’ be locked up,
in which case we can oblige ye,” and the officer
grinned at his joke.</p>

<p>Though the crowd tried to follow, to see Dan
locked in a cell, the constables drove them back,
and fastened the door leading to the jail part of
the building. Dan shuddered when he saw before
him two cages, made of steel bars.</p>

<p>“Do I have to go in there?” he asked hopelessly.</p>

<p>“Yes, ye do!” snapped Constable Wolff. In fact
he was just a little bit ashamed to be locking up a
boy, but he did not want to give in before his official
companion, and, probably Constable Walker
felt the same way. If both of them had been a
little kinder, and not so insistent on doing their
duty to the very limit, Dan could have remained in
an outer room.</p>

<p>As it was they thrust him into a cell, clanged the
heavy door shut, and locked it.</p>

<p>Dan sank on the cot bed in the steel-barred cage.
The footsteps of the constables echoed away down
the hall, and the boy was left alone in the jail.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />


<small>BEFORE THE SQUIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Timothy Perkfell</span> was a justice of the peace
in Hayden. He was called Squire by nearly every
one. The title meant a good deal to Mr. Perkfell,
and he would have felt insulted had any one
omitted it when speaking to him. That is unless
he was called “Judge,” which he liked better than
“Squire.”</p>

<p>The Squire’s office was in a small room back of
Hank Lee’s grocery store, and could be entered
from there. It was a good sized room, for occasionally,
trials for minor offences were held there.
There were a number of chairs, a big stove, a picture
of General Washington and another of the
Governor on the wall. The Squire usually sat at
a big desk, behind a row of law books.</p>

<p>It needed but a glance to tell that the volumes
were law books, because they looked so uninteresting.
They were bound in leather, and, on the
backs, were such titles as “Hampersmith on Contracts,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
“Vroom XLIV,” “Corbin’s Forms,” etc.
The books were always very dusty, which would
seem to indicate that they were seldom used, and
this was the case, for Squire Perkfell knew very little
about law, and certainly not enough to understand
the contents of the big books.</p>

<p>Still it made a good impression to have them on
his desk, and whenever he was in doubt how to decide
a case he would take up one of the volumes,
dust it carefully, pretend to hunt through it for a
decision, and then say something like this:</p>

<p>“Ahem! I have listened to the learned counsel
on both sides, and, on consulting Blackstone in the
celebrated case of Nottingham versus Snagdeck, I
find that there is very much similar in this action.
Blackstone expressed my ideas fully. I therefore
find—” and he would announce his decision.</p>

<p>The Squire was rather an elderly man, with
white hair, a white beard, somewhat stained by tobacco
juice, and he had a glass eye. Perhaps that
is why he did not oftener read his law books. He
was quite dignified, or, at least, he used to think he
was, which amounts to almost the same thing.</p>

<p>It was before this man that poor Dan was to be
given a preliminary hearing, on the charge of being
a burglar. As the Squire had no authority to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
sit as a magistrate he could not finally dispose of
the case. The two constables hurried to the office
and found him sitting at his desk.</p>

<p>“Good mornin’, Squire,” greeted Mr. Walker.</p>

<p>“Ah, good morning, my good man,” replied the
Squire in rather chilling tones.</p>

<p>“How-d’ do, Judge Perkfell,” greeted Constable
Wolff, who saw the somewhat cold welcome his
companion received.</p>

<p>“Ah, officer, good morning. It’s a fine day,” returned
Judge Perkfell, pleased at having his title
conferred on him thus early. “What can I do for
you? Do you wish a warrant, or a subpoena?”</p>

<p>“Neither, thanks,” replied Mr. Wolff, rubbing
his hands at this indication of being on good terms
with the Squire. Mr. Walker felt a little hurt,
and resolved, after this, to always address the justice
as “Judge.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps then, you want me to draw up a deed,
or a mortgage or some legal paper.”</p>

<p>“No, Judge, but we would like you to hold
court.”</p>

<p>“Hold court? Why, you don’t mean to tell me
there is a prisoner in Hayden? I did not hear of
it.”</p>

<p>The Judge, who had only a little while before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
entered his office, had not seen the commotion when
Dan was brought through the town.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir—I mean Judge,” went on Constable
Wolff. “I’ve got a desperate prisoner in the jail.”</p>

<p>“You mean we’ve got him,” interrupted Constable
Walker. “I helped catch him jest th’ same as
you.”</p>

<p>“So ye did, but I discovered the clues.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, officers,” spoke the Judge sharply,
as he did not think it dignified to have a dispute in
his office. “Who is the prisoner?”</p>

<p>“A burglar!” exclaimed Constable Wolff.</p>

<p>“Dan Hardy!” answered Constable Walker in
the same breath.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to tell me Dan Hardy has
been arrested as a burglar?” said the justice, as
much surprised as he thought it consistent with his
dignity to be.</p>

<p>“Yep, Squire—I mean Your Honor,” answered
Mr. Wolff. “I catched—I mean we catched him
this mornin’. He robbed Dr. Maxwell’s house last
night, an’ we discovered part of th’ evidence on
him,” and he showed the spoon he had found in
Dan’s pocket. “Now we want you, if you will, t’
hold court, an’ properly commit him t’ jail, until
th’ Grand Jury can sit on his case.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>“Wait a minute!” exclaimed the Squire. “I am
the person to judge what is to be done in this case,
not the officer who makes the arrest. It may be
that I will find it unnecessary to commit him for
the action of the Grand Inquest. I shall judge of
that when I hear the evidence.”</p>

<p>“But he’s guilty, Mr. Perk—I mean Judge,”
said Mr. Walker quickly.</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried the Squire, offended at the slip
Mr. Walker had made. “I am the proper person
to decide that. You may bring the prisoner before
me in half an hour. Meanwhile I will look up
certain points of law, and I do not wish to be disturbed.
Now clear the court,” and the justice
spoke as if there was a crowd of persons before
him.</p>

<p>The truth was he wanted to be alone, to look
up some authority in the matter and see if he had a
right to hold court in the case of a burglar. He
had never done so before.</p>

<p>It did not take Squire Perkfell long to determine
that he had authority to act in the case of a
person charged with robbery, and then he waited
for the officers to bring Dan in.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two constables went to the jail,
and got their prisoner.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>“What are you going to do with me now?”
asked Dan, curiously.</p>

<p>“Ye’re goin’ t’ be tried,” said Mr. Wolff.</p>

<p>“Will Mr. Savage be there? I think I have a
right to have his testimony,” declared Dan, who,
from having read of trials knew a little about
law.</p>

<p>“I s’pose he’ll be there,” replied Jacob Wolff.
“Mebby ye won’t be so glad t’ see him, after he
tells what he knows. Hank Lee is goin’ t’ testify
too.”</p>

<p>“What does he know about me?”</p>

<p>“Better wait, an’ see.”</p>

<p>“I am entitled to some rights in this matter,”
went on Dan. “I should be represented by a lawyer.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t none in town now,” said Mr. Walker.
“John Burge has gone t’ Canestota, and Ed
Lancing is over t’ his mother’s. But Judge Perkfell
will know what t’ do.”</p>

<p>“I am entitled to a representative in court,” insisted
Dan, “and if I can’t have a lawyer I wish
you would send for Mr. Harrison.”</p>

<p>“What, that blacksmith? He don’t know no
law,” objected Jacob Wolff.</p>

<p>“Maybe not, but he is my friend, and he told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
me to let him know when I was in trouble, and I’m
in trouble now.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’ll tell him,” said Mr. Walker, not
very kindly, for he did not want to lose anything
of what was to take place. “I’ll tell him t’ come t’
Squire Perkfell’s court. Jake, d’ ye think ye kin
manage him?” and he nodded at Dan.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t be afraid, I’m not going to escape,”
said the boy, understanding what was meant.</p>

<p>“I guess ye’d better not,” spoke Mr. Wolff
fiercely taking a better grip on Dan’s coat sleeve.</p>

<p>While one constable went, rather reluctantly, to
summon the veteran blacksmith, the other led Dan
toward Hank Lee’s store, a crowd of persons
gathering as soon as they emerged from the town
hall.</p>

<p>“Where are we going?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Through th’ store, t’ th’ Judge’s office,” replied
Mr. Wolff. “Th’ Judge, he’s lookin’ up th’
law, an’ he don’t want t’ be disturbed fer half an
hour. We’ll wait in Hank’s store.”</p>

<p>“I had rather wait in jail,” spoke Dan, who felt
he would be subjected to ridicule and abuse in the
grocery, with its crowd of men and boys.</p>

<p>“Mebby so, but ye can’t do as ye like when ye’re
under arrest.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>He led the boy into the store. Though it was
quite early there was a big throng in it, for the
rumor had spread that Dan was to have a preliminary
hearing, and all wanted to be present. They
knew they could go through the store into the
Squire’s office.</p>

<p>“Clear th’ way fer th’ representative of th’
law!” exclaimed Jacob Wolff, as he led Dan in.</p>

<p>“Jake’s in his glory now,” said one man.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” added another. “He’d rather
be where he is than President of th’ United States,
I guess.”</p>

<p>Dan was led to a chair, near the door which
opened into the Squire’s office. The half hour was
not quite up, and Mr. Wolff knew better than to
go in before it was time.</p>

<p>“So you got him, did you?” asked Hank Lee,
coming over and standing before the constable and
his prisoner. “I always knowed he was bad. He
played a mean trick on me one day, and I reckon
I’ve got even with him now. I’ll get some reward,
won’t I, for telling you he was the robber?”</p>

<p>“Mebby so,” answered Mr. Wolff. He would
have preferred Mr. Lee should say nothing about
his information, as, if he did, it might take away
from the glory coming to the two officers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“Did you give the constables information that
led to my false arrest?” asked Dan indignantly, of
Hank Lee.</p>

<p>“Yes, I did, and I’m glad they got you. Now
I’m even with you for setting that bull after me. I
told you I’d fix you.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t set the bull after you, Mr. Lee, and it
wasn’t my fault that you were frightened by it.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t frightened, I tell you! I jest ran because
I was afraid he might hit me, and knock the
money out of my pocket. I got up in the tree so’s
I could count it and see if it was right.”</p>

<p>At this version of the story, so different from
the truth Dan could not help smiling. It was evident
that Mr. Lee had told no one exactly what
had happened, or how he had begged Dan not to
desert him, to go for help.</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re laughing now,” sneered the storekeeper,
as he saw the smile on Dan’s face, “but
you’ll be sorry enough when you’re behind the
bars. I always knowed you’d come to no good end.
It runs in the family.”</p>

<p>“See here!” exclaimed Dan, springing to his
feet. “You can insult me, if you will, because you
are bigger and stronger than I am, but you shan’t
insult the memory of my father and mother! I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
come of as good family as you do, and you know it.
You gave false information about me, because you
have a grudge against me. I don’t know what it
was, but it wasn’t true, and I’ll prove it.”</p>

<p>Dan’s righteous anger seemed to get the best
of him, and he struggled to get loose from the restraining
hold of Constable Wolff. He had no
idea what he wanted to do, except he felt as if he
would like to strike the mean storekeeper.</p>

<p>“Here! Hold on!” cried the officer, roughly
dragging Dan back. “None of that! You’re a
prisoner!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re a felon!” added Mr. Lee with a
sneer.</p>

<p>“I’d rather be an innocent prisoner than a
coward!” cried Dan, remembering how the storekeeper
whined when the bull had him up a tree.</p>

<p>“Who’s a coward?”</p>

<p>“You are. You were afraid to stay up the tree
alone when I wanted to go after help to catch the
bull.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Sam Porter, one of the
men in the store. “I didn’t hear the story that
way. Tell us about it, Dan.”</p>

<p>Hardly knowing why he did so, Dan related the
story, showing the cowardice of the storekeeper.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“Ha! Ha! Ho! Ho!” laughed Sam. “That’s
a good one on you, Lee. Treed by a bull, and
dasn’t stick your foot down! Ha! Ho! That’s
prutty good!”</p>

<p>The rest of the crowd joined in the laugh at the
discomfited Mr. Lee, who angrily retired to his
private office to make out bills. Dan had gotten
the best of him, and, somehow the sympathy of
the crowd, which had been rather against the boy,
now turned his way.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door leading to the office of the
Squire opened, and Mr. Perkfell announced:</p>

<p>“Let the prisoner enter. I will now hold court.”</p>

<p>There was a scramble on the part of the crowd
to get good seats, and Constable Wolff led Dan in.
As the boy was arraigned before the Squire, Constable
Walker came in, followed by Mr. Harrison.
Dan’s heart leaped, and his courage came back as
he saw his sturdy friend, the village blacksmith.</p>

<p>“We will now proceed with the hearing,” announced
the justice. “Order in the court!”</p>

<small>THE TRIAL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> minutes passed before the crowd settled
down. There was not room for all to sit, and
many stood up in the back part of the room.</p>

<p>The two constables, placing Dan between them,
took seats near the Squire’s desk. Judge Perkfell
put on his glasses and selected a book from the pile
in front of him. He took the first one he came to,
and opened it at random. This was only done to
impress the onlookers.</p>

<p>“Ahem! Let the prisoner stand up,” called the
justice.</p>

<p>Dan arose.</p>

<p>“Ahem! That will do, be seated.”</p>

<p>Dan did not see what that amounted to. Neither
did any one else but the Squire. To him it showed
the power he had to make prisoners do whatever
he commanded.</p>

<p>“Where is the complainant in this case?” went
on the justice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>No one answered.</p>

<p>“Is the complainant not present? Unless he
answers at once I shall commit him for contempt
of court.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think there is any com—complainant,
Judge,” spoke Mr. Wolff, wondering what the
word meant.</p>

<p>“What? No complainant? Why there must be,
or we can not hold court.”</p>

<p>“Can’t I get you one, your Honor?” asked Mr.
Walker, determined to make up for past offenses.
“If you tell me where it is I’ll bring it.”</p>

<p>“The complainant is the person who makes the
complaint—who brings the charge—who accuses
the prisoner,” explained the justice, frowning, as
he saw some persons smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m makin’ th’ charge,” replied Constable
Wolff.</p>

<p>“So am I!” exclaimed his fellow officer quickly,
for he was not going to be left out of the affair.</p>

<p>“You are both complainants? Why, I understood
it was Dr. Maxwell’s house that was burglarized.”</p>

<p>“So it was,” said Mr. Walker quickly.</p>

<p>“Then Dr. Maxwell is the complainant. Is he
present?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“He has got to see a sick lady,” explained Silas
Martin, the doctor’s hired man, as he stood up in
the back of the room, blushing very much at the
notice he attracted.</p>

<p>“Ah, in that case we will proceed without him,
and we can have his evidence later. A doctor is
privileged to stay away from court, to attend the
sick, as laid down in the Atlantic Reporter, 638,
Barker <i>versus</i> Sanderson, but for no other cause.
Otherwise I should have had to commit Dr. Maxwell
for contempt of court.”</p>

<p>There was a sort of gasp at this, as the Squire
intended there should be, for, as he thought, it
showed his power.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile we will proceed with the case. I
will hear the evidence of the two representatives
of the law.”</p>

<p>The constables straightened up in their chairs
at thus hearing themselves mentioned.</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Harrison, the blacksmith,
went over and took a seat beside Dan.</p>

<p>“Here!” exclaimed the Judge. “What are you
doing? You have no right there.”</p>

<p>“I am here to look after the interest of
the prisoner, Dan Hardy,” said Mr. Harrison
firmly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“But you’re not a lawyer. You’re only a blacksmith.”</p>

<p>“I know it, Squire Perkfell, but one does not
need to be a lawyer to represent a person in the
court of a justice of the peace. Your law books
will tell you that.”</p>

<p>Perhaps they would, but the Squire did not
know where to look for the information. He was
half inclined to dispute the word of the blacksmith,
but he thought better of it.</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Harrison was right, and he was
entitled to represent Dan. The Squire knew
enough of law to realize that a prisoner ought to
be represented by some one. He thought it ought
to be a lawyer, but if the blacksmith insisted,
perhaps it would not be wise to disagree with
him.</p>

<p>“Very well,” announced the Justice, after a
moment’s thought, “I will allow you to represent
the prisoner,—temporarily, however, only temporarily.
I may change my decision later, as the
case develops.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison smiled.</p>

<p>“I now demand the right to have a few minutes
private conversation with my—my client,” said the
blacksmith.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Squire Perkfell did not know what to do. This
was something new in his practice.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it!” exclaimed Constable Wolff.
“Don’t allow it, your Honor. It’s a plot t’ let him
escape!”</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried the Squire. “I am in charge of
this court!”</p>

<p>He dimly remembered once being at a trial
where a lawyer made such a demand, and the judge
granted it. Squire Perkfell prided himself on
knowing law, and he wanted to do what was right,
so he said:</p>

<p>“Very well, your request is granted. But you
must talk to the prisoner in this room. You may
withdraw to a corner.”</p>

<p>“That will do,” assented Mr. Harrison, and he
led Dan to a part of the room where he could converse
with him quietly. The two constables
watched him narrowly. Dan told his friend all
the events of the night ride, including the finding
of the spoon, and the actions of the mysterious
men. Then he led the boy back to his seat, and
spoke to the Squire.</p>

<p>“We are ready to proceed,” he said.</p>

<p>“Who is the first witness?” asked the justice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
who, in the meanwhile, had been asking Constable
Wolff more about the case.</p>

<p>“Si Martin,” answered Jacob Wolff, who had
assumed the role of prosecutor. “He discovered
the robbery.”</p>

<p>“Silas Martin, step forward,” called the Squire,
and the doctor’s hired man, blushing like a girl,
shambled to the desk.</p>

<p>“Now tell the Court what you know.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ about it. I didn’t see Dan
steal anythin’. I don’t believe he done it. Neither
does Dr. Maxwell, an’ he told me t’ say so. He’s
comin’ here as soon as he can.”</p>

<p>“The court can not await the convenience of any
one,” said the justice with dignity. “Nor does it
want you to express your opinion as to the guilt or
innocence of a prisoner. Just tell what you know
of the robbery.”</p>

<p>Thereupon Silas related what we already know,
of how he discovered that the house had been entered,
and the silver and other things taken. Next
he told of his visit to the constables, and what Mr.
Lee had said regarding Dan’s midnight ride.</p>

<p>The storekeeper was called and gave his evidence.
It began to look black for Dan, especially
when the constables added their story of him being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
up the tree, and of the finding of the spoon in his
pocket.</p>

<p>“That seems to be the case for the prosecution,”
remarked the Squire. “Is the defense ready to
proceed?” And he looked at Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“We are,” replied the blacksmith. “I want to
ask some questions of the witnesses. I did not interrupt
them while they were testifying, as I
wanted to hear the whole story. First I would
like to call Mr. Lee back to the stand.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no time to bother with this case any
more,” replied the storekeeper. “I told all I know.
I’ve got to go back and wait on some customers.”</p>

<p>“Take the stand!” exclaimed the justice. “You
are a material witness in this case, and, until you
are excused by the court, you must remain. I will
commit you for contempt if you go away.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lee scowled. He was angry at the justice,
and he privately resolved to raise his rent as soon
as the case was over, for he owned the office where
the Squire held court.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />


<small>HELD IN BAIL</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> blacksmith, who had made several notes
when Dan told him the story, looked at the paper
in his hand. He had often seen court-martial
trials in the army and knew how to proceed.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lee,” he said, “you have testified to seeing
the defendant, some time early this morning,
riding on a horse, and carrying a bundle. Is that
correct?”</p>

<p>“I seen Dan Hardy, if that’s who you mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is the defendant in this case. Now will
you state to the court just how large this bundle
was?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, it wasn’t very big.”</p>

<p>“As big as a bushel basket?”</p>

<p>“No, of course not. He had it in his pocket,
and I’d like to see any one carry a bushel basket
there and ride a horse.”</p>

<p>“Well, how big was it?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“How do I know?”</p>

<p>“You said you saw it, and have so testified under
oath.”</p>

<p>Mr. Lee squirmed in his seat.</p>

<p>“Wa’al,” he said at length, “I didn’t see it very
plain. It was dark at the time.”</p>

<p>“Yet you have stated to the court under oath
that you saw Dan Hardy very plainly when you
got up to get something to stop your toothache.
You have testified that you saw him have a bundle.
Now I want you to state to the court the size of
that bundle.”</p>

<p>The room was very still now. Clearly something
was coming, and the crowd did not want to
miss it.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I guess it was about as big as a quart
measure,” said Mr. Lee at length.</p>

<p>“You swear to that?”</p>

<p>“I s’pose so.”</p>

<p>“That will do.”</p>

<p>There was a murmur of surprise at the sudden
ending of the storekeeper’s testimony.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” asked Mr. Lee, apparently much
relieved.</p>

<p>“Yes. Call Silas Martin.”</p>

<p>The hired man, still blushing, returned to the
witness stand.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>“Silas,” began the blacksmith in a kindly tone,
“can you swear as to how much stuff was taken
away from Dr. Maxwell’s house?”</p>

<p>“Pretty near, Mr. Harrison.”</p>

<p>“What was it?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, there was a lot of spoons, forks, knives,
a big silver water pitcher, a silver sugar bowl, a
silver coffee pot, a silver coffee urn and—”</p>

<p>“In fact there was quite a bulky lot of stuff, was
there not?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“About how large a bundle would it make?”</p>

<p>Once more the crowd gave a sort of gasp. They
began to see to what end Mr. Harrison was asking
questions.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I used t’ clean th’ pitchers, urns an’
sugar bowl once a week,” testified Silas, “an’ I
used t’ put ’em all in a basket t’ carry ’em out t’
th’ harness room t’ polish ’em.”</p>

<p>“How big a basket did you put them in, Silas?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, by careful managin’ I could git th’
water pitcher, th’ milk pitcher, th’ sugar bowl, th’
coffee pot an’ th’ tea pot in a bushel basket.”</p>

<p>“Was there room for anything more?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit.”</p>

<p>“Then the things stolen from Dr. Maxwell’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
house would more than fill a bushel basket?”</p>

<p>“They’d pretty near fill two.”</p>

<p>“That is all, Silas.”</p>

<p>“Ye don’t want me no more?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not, but perhaps some of these other
gentlemen might like to question you,” and Mr.
Harrison motioned to the two constables.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t want to,” said Mr. Wolff, and Mr.
Walker also indicated that he desired to take no
part in the matter.</p>

<p>“Then I think you may go, Silas,” said Mr.
Harrison.</p>

<p>“Before I go I want t’ say I don’t believe Dan
Hardy robbed th’ house!” exclaimed Silas.</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried the justice, who, for the last
few minutes had felt that he was being ignored.
“If you say that again I shall commit you for contempt
of court.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I said it all I want t’,” murmured Silas,
as he went back to his place in the rear of the
room.</p>

<p>“Squire Perkfell,” began the blacksmith, “I
think I have brought out enough evidence to prove
that Dan had no part in this robbery. Mr. Lee
has testified that the bundle Dan had was the size
of a quart measure. The doctor’s hired man, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
is in a position to know, swears that the booty
taken from the house would more than fill a bushel
basket. I therefore submit that the bundle Dan
had was not stolen property, and I shall prove
it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Savage was next called, and, though he was
rather an unwilling witness in behalf of Dan, he
told of sending the lad to Mrs. Randall’s house
with the medicine, which was brought back. He
thus accounted for Dan’s night trip, and for the
package the boy carried.</p>

<p>“Dan Hardy, take the stand,” called Mr. Harrison,
and Dan, with firm tread, and head held
erect, walked forward to give his evidence. He
told of his night ride, and of seeing the mysterious
men, also of his intention to slip to the village and
inform the constables without bothering to tell Mr.
Savage.</p>

<p>“What about th’ spoon we found in his pocket?”
asked Constable Wolff triumphantly.</p>

<p>“Explain that, Dan,” said Mr. Harrison, and
Dan did so, telling how he had found the article.</p>

<p>There was a murmur in the courtroom at this.
It was plain that many persons, if they did not
believe Dan guilty, did think he was in league with
the robbers. There were sneering whispers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>“In view of what had been testified, and from
the lack of any positive evidence that my client was
involved in this robbery, I respectfully ask his discharge,”
said Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“Don’t let him go free! He’s guilty!” exclaimed
Constable Walker, who hated to see his prisoner
set at liberty.</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried the justice. “I shall commit
you for contempt.”</p>

<p>He glared around in a menacing manner.</p>

<p>“Ahem!” he went on portentously. “I have
carefully listened to all the evidence in this case.
The prisoner seems able to prove a fairly good
alibi—”</p>

<p>“What’s that. I wonder,” whispered Constable
Walker to Constable Wolff.</p>

<p>“Sh! That means he was somewhere else when
he done th’ crime.”</p>

<p>“But how could he be somewhere’s else?—”</p>

<p>“Silence!” cried the justice, glaring at the two
officers. Then he went on:</p>

<p>“In spite of the seeming alibi, and the testimony
about the size of the bundle he had, the discovery
of the spoon in his pocket is very damaging. I shall
express no opinion in the matter, but I feel obliged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
to hold the prisoner in one thousand dollars bail to
await the action of the Grand Jury.</p>

<p>“If he can not furnish the bail, or a satisfactory
bondsman, who owns property worth at least twice
the amount of the bail, I shall have to commit the
prisoner to jail. Court is adjourned.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />


<small>A FRIEND IN NEED</small></h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Dan</span> was bitterly disappointed. He thought
when Mr. Harrison had brought out the evidence
so clearly, and when it was testified that he was far
away from the scene of the robbery, that the justice
would give a verdict of “not guilty.”</p>

<p>“What does it mean?” asked the boy, much bewildered.</p>

<p>“It means ye’ll have t’ go back t’ jail, that’s what
it means,” declared Constable Walker vindictively.</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ stay there ’till yer regular trial at th’
county court house,” added Constable Wolff.</p>

<p>“That is unless you can get some one to go on
your bond for a thousand dollars,” explained Justice
Perkfell, not so gruffly as he had spoken before.
He was well satisfied with himself, and the
way he had conducted the case.</p>

<p>“You mean if I can get some one to sign a paper
I can go free until my regular trial?”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“That’s it, but whoever signs the paper must be
worth at least two thousand dollars. He would
be security for your appearance to be tried, that is
if the Grand Jury finds an indictment against you.
If you should run away in the meanwhile, whoever
went on your bond would have to pay a thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>Dan naturally thought of his employer, who was
quite wealthy. Certainly he was worth two thousand
dollars.</p>

<p>“Will you go bail for me?” asked the boy, turning
to Mr. Savage.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” inquired the farmer, as if he
had not heard aright.</p>

<p>“Will you be my bondsman?”</p>

<p>“Your bondsman? Go yer bail fer a thousand
dollars? Wa’al, I guess not much, Dan Hardy!
You must think I’ve got money t’ throw away,”
cried the miserly farmer.</p>

<p>“But it would not cost you anything. All you
would have to do would be to sign the paper.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ ef ye took a notion t’ skip out between
now an’ th’ time of yer trial, I’d have t’ pay th’
thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“But I promise I’ll not ‘skip out’ as you call it
Mr. Savage.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Wa’al, I ain’t takin’ th’ word of a thief!”</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m a thief?” asked Dan indignantly.</p>

<p>“Ain’t ye jest been found guilty?”</p>

<p>“No, he has not!” exclaimed Mr. Harrison.
“Only a jury of twelve men has a right to say
whether or not he is guilty. He is only held for
trial.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I ain’t goin’ t’ risk no thousand dollars
on him.”</p>

<p>“Then you’ll not go on my bond?” queried Dan.</p>

<p>“Not much I won’t!”</p>

<p>Poor Dan was down-hearted again. He counted
on being allowed his freedom, for he had resolved
to do his best to trace the real robbers, and so
clear his good name.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I guess ye’d better come along t’ jail
now,” said Constable Wolff. “There ain’t nobody
goin’ yer bail. Come on,” and he caught Dan by
the coat sleeve to lead him away.</p>

<p>“Stop!” cried Mr. Harrison in a ringing voice.</p>

<p>“What fer?” demanded the constable.</p>

<p>“Dan needn’t stay in jail until his trial comes
off.”</p>

<p>“I’d like t’ know why? Ain’t nobody goin’ his
bail.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“I am!”</p>

<p>“You are?” and the constable sneered. “I’d
like t’ know where ye got two thousand dollars t’
go on anybody’s bail. Ye ain’t worth more’n two
hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“I must require good security,” hastily interposed
Justice Perkfell. “Very good security.”</p>

<p>“And I can furnish it!” exclaimed the veteran,
standing close beside Dan, as though he would protect
the boy. “I will go on this boy’s bond for a
thousand—yes, for ten thousand dollars, for I
know he is innocent!”</p>

<p>“Talk’s cheap, but it takes money t’ go on bail
bonds,” came from Constable Walker. “Everybody
knows ye ain’t got no ten thousand dollars,
Mr. Harrison.”</p>

<p>“Then everybody is mistaken,” replied the
sturdy old blacksmith with a smile. “I was not
worth ten thousand dollars a few days ago, but I
am now. Justice Perkfell, I’ll ask you to look at
those papers,” and he handed the Squire a bundle
of documents.</p>

<p>The old justice adjusted his glasses and began to
examine the documents, while the crowd waited
impatiently.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>“Does that show whether I can qualify in the
sum of two thousand dollars and go on Dan’s
bond?” asked the veteran.</p>

<p>“Ahem! I—er—must admit it does,” replied
the Squire. “I must, under the law accept you as
bondsman for the prisoner, if you desire to take
that responsibility.”</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>“I may add, for the information of those present,”
went on the justice, who was not going to
miss a chance to make a speech, “that the papers I
have examined show that Mr. Harrison has been
left considerable property, including some real estate,
which is necessary for a bondsman to have.
This property, it appears, comes from a distant
relative, and I should say, from the statement of
the lawyers, that it was worth at least ten thousand
dollars.”</p>

<p>“Fully that,” replied the blacksmith quietly. “It
was an unexpected legacy for me, and I never was
more surprised in my life than when I got it. It
came from a distant cousin, all of whose relatives,
save myself, had died. I am glad it came when it
did, for it enables me to do my friend Dan a service.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>The bond was soon made out and the blacksmith
signed it.</p>

<p>“Now, Dan,” he said, “you are at liberty. I
hope you’ll not run away, since I have gone on
your bond.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I will not, Mr. Harrison. I’m going
to stay right around here, and see if I can’t discover
the burglars. May I go now?” he asked of the
justice.</p>

<p>“Yes. You are now under bail for the Grand
Jury’s action. They may indict you, and they may
not.”</p>

<p>“Then he ain’t got t’ go t’ jail?” asked Peter
Savage, and he seemed a little disappointed.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Squire Perkfell.</p>

<p>“Then ye’d better come back t’ th’ farm with
me, Dan,” exclaimed his employer. “Ye’ve lost
enough time as ’tis. It’s past dinner time, an’
there’s lots of chores t’ be done. Come along, step
lively!”</p>

<p>Dan made a sudden resolution.</p>

<p>“Mr. Savage, I’m not going back to the farm
with you!” he said.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I say I’m not going back to the farm. I’m
done working for you. Besides, I don’t see why<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
you should want in your house a boy whom you
consider a thief. I’m done with you forever!”</p>

<p>If a bomb had been exploded under the feet of
Mr. Peter Savage, he could not have been more
surprised.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />


<small>A NEW HOME</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Look</span> a-here, Dan Hardy!” sputtered Mr. Savage,
“don’t ye talk that way t’ me. I say ye’re
goin’ back t’ th’ farm, an’ back ye shall go. Th’
idea! After all I done fer ye, now ye’re out on bail,
an’ ye won’t come an’ work fer me.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you offer to go his bond, if you
are so anxious to have him come and work for
you?” asked Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I—er—that is I was—What’s that
your business, anyhow?” burst out Mr. Savage, for
the question confused him. “I say he’s comin’
back with me. Come here, young man, step
lively.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going with you, Mr. Savage,” answered
Dan firmly.</p>

<p>“I say ye be! Squire, make him come. I’ve got
a claim on him.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a claim?” inquired the blacksmith.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“Wa’al, its a good claim.”</p>

<p>“Are you his guardian, legally appointed by the
court?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t his guardian, but I’ve got a claim
on him.”</p>

<p>“Have you legally adopted him?”</p>

<p>“Course not. Think I’d adopt sech a lazy
boy?”</p>

<p>“It’s rather strange that you should be so insistent
on having a ‘lazy’ boy, as you call him, work
for you. But can you produce any papers, showing
that you have a legal claim on him?”</p>

<p>“I ain’t got no papers, an’ I don’t want none.
I’ve got a claim on him, an’ I’m goin’ t’ have him.
Didn’t I save him from goin’ t’ th’ poorhouse, an’
ain’t I fed an’ clothed him since?”</p>

<p>“If you have, he has more than earned what he
got. Dan,” went on the aged veteran, “you need
not go back to the farm unless you want to. Squire
Perkfell will tell you that Mr. Savage has no legal
claim on you.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right,” ventured the Justice
though he rather disliked to side with the boy who
had been a prisoner before him.</p>

<p>“All right then!” exclaimed the angry farmer,
“go t’ th’ poorhouse! That’s th’ place fer ye!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
But mind ye, don’t ye come around me, askin’ t’ be
took back. I’ll never let ye set foot in my place
ag’in. Now who’s goin’ t’ look after ye?”</p>

<p>“I am!” exclaimed Mr. Harrison. “Dan shall
come and live with me. I have enough for both
of us.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” sneered Mr. Savage. “He’ll make
a fine blacksmith.”</p>

<p>“I intend giving up the blacksmithing business,”
said the old soldier. “Fortunately this legacy of
ten thousand dollars makes me independent. But
I do not intend to be idle. I am going into business,
and Dan can help. Come, Dan.”</p>

<p>There were more murmurs of surprise from the
crowd in the courtroom. So many surprises had
never before occurred in one day. There was
enough to talk about for a month.</p>

<p>“Good riddance t’ ye!” exclaimed Peter Savage,
giving Dan an ugly look.</p>

<p>The boy stepped forward.</p>

<p>“I have a case of books at your house, Mr. Savage,”
he said. “I want to get them. May I?”</p>

<p>“No, ye can’t have ’em!”</p>

<p>“But they are mine. They were given to me by
my father, and I want them.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, ye can’t have ’em.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>“What right have you to retain books belonging
to Dan?” asked the blacksmith.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep ’em t’ make up fer all th’ trouble he
made me. I may have t’ pay damages fer what th’
bull done, an’ it was his fault.”</p>

<p>“It was not!” exclaimed Dan.</p>

<p>“Hush! Never mind,” advised Mr. Harrison.
“Don’t dispute with him now, Dan,” he added in
a whisper. “I’ll find a way to get the books.”</p>

<p>Mr. Savage left the courtroom, with a leer on
his hard looking face. He felt that he had the
best of Dan, though he was somewhat put out that
the boy was not coming back with him. It meant
that the old farmer would have to do more work
himself, and he knew his wife would miss Dan
around the house.</p>

<p>“I can’t thank you enough for all you did for
me, Mr. Harrison,” said the boy, as he and his
friend went out of the Justice’s room, part of the
crowd following them.</p>

<p>“Then don’t try, Dan. I only did my duty by
you. I am glad I had the opportunity of going on
your bond. I could not have done it a week ago.”</p>

<p>“And have you really fallen heir to ten thousand
dollars?”</p>

<p>“Yes, strange as it may seem, I have. I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
the most surprised man in the world when the
lawyer sent me the papers, and the deeds to the
property, which is located in the northern part of
this township.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you have undertaken too big a contract,
to take me home with you,” went on Dan.
“I don’t want to be a bother to you.”</p>

<p>“Never fear, you and I will get along nicely
together. It is true I have not a very fine home
now, but I intend soon to have a better one. If
you will not mind putting up with a few inconveniences
we shall do very well.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure it is very kind of you. Nothing could
be more inconvenient than where I was. I slept in
the attic, and in the winter the snow used to come
in on my bed through a crack in the roof. It was
not so bad in the summer time.”</p>

<p>“Well, there is nothing much at my house, but,
as I say, we will soon have a better one. I intend
to sell out my business as soon as I can, and start
a small machine shop in the village. I think one is
needed. Part of the property I inherited is near
the river, and I can build a shop run by water
power, which will be economical. I will hire
several men, and if you wish, you can work for
me.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>“I should not ask anything better,” said Dan.
“I did not like farm work, but I did it because
there was nothing else to do. I am fond of
machinery.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we shall make an engineer of you.”</p>

<p>“That would be fine. But I wish I had my
books from the farm house. I want to keep on
with my studies.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. I’ll find a way to secure them
for you.”</p>

<p>Thus Dan found a new home, and a much better
one than he had had since his mother died.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />


<small>DAN’S MIDNIGHT VISIT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> door to the blacksmith shop was a small
house where Mr. Harrison lived alone. He did
his own cooking, and, once or twice a week, he
hired a woman from the village to come in and do
some cleaning. It was to this rather humble home
that the old soldier took Dan.</p>

<p>“The first thing we’ll do will be to have dinner,”
said Mr. Harrison. “I suppose you are hungry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, for I had very little breakfast, and I have
been kept pretty busy since.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll cook something, and then we can
discuss some plans.”</p>

<p>The blacksmith proved that he knew how to get
a meal, for he had often served as camp cook in
the army.</p>

<p>“Can’t I wash up the dishes for you?” asked
Dan, when they were through eating. “I often did
for Mrs. Savage.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Yes, if you like. Then you can come to the
smithy. I have some work I promised to finish
for a man, and it is rather a difficult job.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid you were delayed by coming to my
trial,” said Dan.</p>

<p>“It was a delay I was glad of, since I could be
of service to you.”</p>

<p>When Dan went into the smithy, after washing
and drying the dishes, he found Mr. Harrison
hard at work.</p>

<p>“No one would think you had just fallen heir
to a large sum,” said the boy, for to him ten thousand
dollars was a great deal of money.</p>

<p>“I do not intend to let the money make any
difference to me, except that I shall do work on a
larger scale,” remarked the blacksmith. “I intend
to keep the shop going until I can sell it, for I
have several contracts to complete, and it would
not be right to drop them. There is no other
blacksmith in the village to whom people can go.
Besides, I like to work.”</p>

<p>It would seem so, from the way the sturdy old
man rained blow after blow on a glowing piece of
iron, hammering it into shape, while the red sparks
flew all around.</p>

<p>When the iron cooled he thrust it into the forge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
fire, and, with bared arms he worked the bellows
handle causing the flames and sparks to shoot up
the chimney, and lighting the smithy with a yellow
glow.</p>

<p>“Can’t I help at something?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Yes, if you like. There is a box of nails and
screws that are all mixed up. I wish you would
sort them according to sizes, and put them into
small boxes. It is something I have often tried in
vain to get time to do.”</p>

<p>Dan set to work with a will. Even in the smithy,
which naturally was not a very clean place, he liked
it better than on the farm.</p>

<p>Dan and the blacksmith continued to live together,
the boy helping with odd jobs around the
shop, and learning much that was afterward to
prove useful to him. The excitement caused by the
trial had somewhat died away, and during the next
two weeks though the two constables spent part of
every day looking for clues to the robbers, they
found none.</p>

<p>“The town ought to hire a detective from the
city,” said Mr. Harrison one evening, when, after
the day’s work was done, he and Dan were talking
the matter over.</p>

<p>“Yes, I wish they would find out who robbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
the place. My trial will come off in the fall, and
unless there is some evidence discovered they may
find me guilty.”</p>

<p>“No jury would ever convict you on such flimsy
testimony.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not, but I don’t even want to go to
trial. I want the real robbers discovered.”</p>

<p>“I hope they will be. By the way, did Mr. Savage
answer your letter which you wrote him, making
a formal demand for your books?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He said he would not give them up.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall compel him to by legal means.
The books are yours, and you shall have
them.”</p>

<p>It was several days after this that Dan was
thinking over the matter of the books. He did not
want his friend, the blacksmith, to have to go to
the expense of a lawsuit to recover the volumes.</p>

<p>“I’ve been bother enough to him,” thought Dan.
“I believe I can get those books myself. I have a
right to them, and I’m going to get them.”</p>

<p>He was alone in the smithy, doing a simple job
of repairing with which Mr. Harrison had entrusted
him. The blacksmith was away from
home, having gone to a distant town to see a man
in reference to selling him the shop. After finishing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
the work Dan sat down and did some thinking.</p>

<p>“I believe I’ll do it,” he said to himself, coming
to a sudden decision. “Mr. Harrison will not be
at home to-night, and, if there is any trouble over
it, he will not be involved. I can stay out as late
as I like and he will ask no questions. I’ll do it
to-night.”</p>

<p>What Dan had resolved upon was rather a rash
thing, but he did not think so at the time. Boys,
when they feel that they are in the right, often go
ahead regardless of consequences. It was so in
Dan’s case.</p>

<p>He had decided to get the books that belonged
to him, and this was how he was going to do it. He
knew they were in the attic room, and he also
knew, from experience, that he could get into the
room from the old apple tree, as he had done that
day when the constables caught him as he was
coming down.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock that night Dan left the little
cottage where he and Mr. Harrison lived. He
wore an old coat, and had his cap pulled down over
his face. Though he was doing what he felt he
had a right to, still he did not want any one to see
him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>By a roundabout way Dan reached the apple
orchard back of Peter Savage’s home. The house
was all in darkness, as he knew it would be, for the
family went to bed early, to save kerosene oil. Still
Dan waited until midnight, to be sure every one
was sound asleep.</p>

<p>Then the boy cautiously climbed the tree. He
went slowly, made no noise, and soon reached the
limb which was outside the window of his former
room.</p>

<p>Making his way along this he found the window
open and stepped inside. Even in the dark he
knew where to find his books. He took them from
the case and began to tie them up in two bundles
with some strong cord he had bought. He intended
lowering them from the window with a
rope, and then climb down the tree.</p>

<p>Just as he was ready to lower the books, the
door of the room suddenly opened and standing
there, with a lamp in his hand, was Mr. Savage.
Behind him was his wife. They were in their night
dresses and Mrs. Savage held a poker.</p>

<p>“So, Dan Hardy, we’ve caught ye!” she exclaimed.
“Not content with robbin’ th’ doctor’s
house, ye’ve turned regular burglar, an’ are tryin’
t’ rob us! Catch him, Peter, he’ll not git off so
easy this time!”</p>

<small>THE FALLING CHIMNEY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> a moment Dan did not know what to do.
He was too surprised to speak, and, though he had
been caught, almost like a burglar, he knew he
morally had the right to do what he had done.</p>

<p>“So it was you, makin’ th’ noise that woke us
up, was it, Dan Hardy?” asked Mr. Savage, advancing
into the room. “Ye’re goin’ t’ th’ bad
fast. Now ye’ll have t’ deliver up whatever ye
stole from my house, an’ then I’ll send fer th’ constables.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t stolen anything from your house,
Mr. Savage!”</p>

<p>“Then what did ye come sneakin’ in here fer,
like a thief in th’ night?”</p>

<p>“I came after my books, which you refused to
let me have. Now that I have them I am going to
leave.”</p>

<p>“Ye be, eh? Wa’al, I guess I’ll have suthin’ t’
say about that. Likely story! Come here t’ git<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
a few wuthless books! More like ye come here t’
git th’ money ye heard I drawed out th’ bank!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know you drew any money out of the
bank.”</p>

<p>“Ye’re a thief, Dan Hardy, an’ ye know it!”
exclaimed Mrs. Savage. “Catch him, Peter. I’ll
hold him while ye’ go over t’ Mr. Lane’s an’ telephone
fer th’ constables.”</p>

<p>“I tell you I only came here for my books, and
you have no right to molest me,” declared Dan.</p>

<p>“We’ll see how much of that th’ judge will believe,”
sneered Mr. Savage. “Ye’d better come
along with me, an’ make no trouble.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not come with you.”</p>

<p>Dan formed a sudden resolution. With a quick
motion he threw his books from the window. Then
he turned and made for it himself. It did not take
long to get out on the limb, and, a few seconds
later he was climbing down to the ground.</p>

<p>“Catch him! Stop him! Hold him!” cried
Mrs. Savage. “Why don’t ye hold him, Peter?”</p>

<p>“Hold him, Susan? Might as well try t’ hold
an eel after it’s got away from ye. Can’t ye see
he’s gone?”</p>

<p>“Thieves! Robbers!” cried the woman. “Dan
Hardy tried to rob th’ house!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>Her cries awakened the hired men, but, by the
time they had slipped on their trousers and come
out, Dan was far away. He had grabbed up his
books and run across the fields to the road. Then
he walked to Mr. Harrison’s house.</p>

<p>“Well, I got my books,” said the boy as he undressed
and went to bed, “but I suppose there’ll
be a row over it.”</p>

<p>The blacksmith came back early the next day,
and Dan told him all about it.</p>

<p>“I am a little sorry you did that,” said Mr. Harrison,
“yet I don’t know as I blame you. Mr. Savage
was a mean man to retain the books, and,
though you were not proceeding strictly according
to law, you were morally in the right. I think
whatever violation of law there was, is so slight
that it need cause you no worry. Still I will go
and see Squire Perkfell, as Mr. Savage will probably
try to have a warrant issued for your arrest.”</p>

<p>Nor was the old soldier mistaken in his surmise.
When he got to the Squire’s office he found the
angry farmer there.</p>

<p>“Ah, good morning,” remarked the Justice
pleasantly, when he saw the blacksmith. It was
quite a different greeting than the one he had given
when Mr. Harrison wanted to represent Dan at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
the trial. But then matters were different now.
Mr. Harrison was quite wealthy, according to the
Hayden standard, and the justice thought perhaps
he might be given some legal work to do for the
rich blacksmith.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” returned Mr. Harrison. “I
came in to see you about a certain matter, when
you have finished with Mr. Savage.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, my business has got t’ be attended to,
an’ I don’t care who knows it,” said the farmer.
“I want a warrant fer th’ arrest of that Hardy
boy.”</p>

<p>“Then my business is the same as yours,” said
the blacksmith. “We will discuss it together.”</p>

<p>“No, we won’t discuss nothin’. I want him arrested,
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes. Of course,” said the Squire. “Certainly.
I will attend to it. Now what do you
charge him with Mr. Savage?”</p>

<p>The truth was Squire Perkfell was between two
fires. He wanted to please the blacksmith, because
he knew he had money, and he wanted to keep on
friendly terms with Mr. Savage, who was also
wealthy and a power in the community, and who
was to be reckoned with on election day.</p>

<p>“I charge him with bein’ a burglar, an’ with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
comin’ inter my house at midnight t’ rob an’ steal,”
declared Mr. Savage.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we can simplify matters” interposed
Mr. Harrison. “Did he break into your house,
Mr. Savage?”</p>

<p>“No, he come in a winder that was left open.”</p>

<p>“Then I think I am right, Squire, in saying there
can be no charge of breaking entered against
Dan.”</p>

<p>“No, no. You’re right. If he didn’t break any
doors or windows to get in, he can’t be charged
with breaking,” agreed the Justice. “To arrest a
burglar, charged with breaking, entering and stealing,
he must be guilty of all three things.”</p>

<p>“So, then, Dan broke nothing,” resumed the
blacksmith. “Did he steal anything, Mr. Savage?”</p>

<p>“He took some books.”</p>

<p>“Whose were they?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, his own, I s’pose, but I was holdin’
em.”</p>

<p>“Which you had no legal right to do. Then
Dan did not steal anything.”</p>

<p>“Guess you’re right,” agreed the Justice. “You
can’t properly charge him with stealing, Mr. Savage.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>“Wa’al, he entered, didn’t he?” asked the farmer,
satisfied that he could have Dan arrested on this
charge.</p>

<p>“He entered, through a window, which was not
fastened, and took property that belonged to him,
which you unlawfully retained,” said Mr. Harrison.
“I admit there might have been a technical
violation of the law on Dan’s part, but there was
also a violation on the part of Mr. Savage. If he
insists on having a warrant for Dan on the charge
of entering, I shall ask for one, on Dan’s behalf,
for the arrest of Mr. Savage.”</p>

<p>“On what charge?” asked the Justice nervously,
for he did not want to have to arrest such an influential
and rich man as Mr. Savage.</p>

<p>“On the charge of unlawfully converting to his
own use the property of another,” answered the
blacksmith. “Now you can take your choice, Mr.
Savage. Either drop this silly charge, or I will
make one against you.”</p>

<p>“I—I think Mr. Harrison is right,” said Squire
Perkfell, nervously rubbing his hands together.</p>

<p>“Humph! I’ll git even with him, an’ Dan too,”
growled the farmer as he left the office of the
Justice. He had decided that discretion was the
better part of valor, and he was not sure but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
he had acted unlawfully, as indeed he had, in keeping
Dan’s books.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s all settled,” said the blacksmith to
Dan, when he came back home. “Now you can
rest easy.”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly,” answered Dan. “I have still
to find the rascals who robbed the doctor’s house.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we may in time. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>But Dan did, though it did no good. The weeks
passed, and there was no clue to those who had
burglarized the doctor’s house. Of course Dan
had, with the aid of Mr. Harrison, made a search
in the woods, where he had seen the mysterious
men, but nothing was found. Either it was well
hidden, or the robbers, if such they were, had
taken their booty away again.</p>

<p>The summer began to wane. Mr. Harrison
had not yet found a purchaser for his smithy, and
he continued to work there, as the machine shop
he had started to build was not ready for operations.
It might seem queer for a man with ten
thousand dollars to be working at the forge, like
a common blacksmith, but Mr. Harrison liked the
exercise, and he knew if he stopped, the people in
the neighborhood would have to go a long distance
to get any work of that nature done. Besides he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
had some special machinery to put in his new shop,
and part of it he could build better himself than
he could hire done.</p>

<p>So he and Dan continued to live together, working
in the smithy from day to day. The boy was
acquiring valuable information, and he had plenty
of time to study.</p>

<p>One day, Dan and his friend were working on a
large iron frame that needed welding. It was so
large that Mr. Harrison had to stand inside it,
while it rested on the anvil. Dan stood in front
to steady it.</p>

<p>It had just been taken from the fire, where one
part was heated white hot, for welding, and Mr.
Harrison was raining blows on it with a small
sledge hammer when Dan, looking up, uttered an
exclamation of fear.</p>

<p>The big brick chimney, in which the forge was
constructed was cracking, for it was quite old. As
Dan watched he saw it start to topple over, right
on Mr. Harrison, who could not get out of the
way because he was inside the frame, which was
like a big cage.</p>

<p>“Look out!” cried Dan. “The chimney is falling!”</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer to Mr. Harrison, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
trying in vain to extricate himself from the
framework, came the heavy mass of bricks and
mortar. He was in danger of being crushed to
death.</p>

<p>Then Dan did a risky thing. Dropping his end
of the frame he ran around in behind the anvil,
and, exerting all his strength, he raised the mass of
iron rods, holding the frame up so Mr. Harrison
could crawl to one side.</p>

<p>“Quick! Come out!” cried the boy.</p>

<p>The blacksmith saw his opportunity and made
a rapid move to safety. Then Dan leaped out of
the way, and not an instant too soon, for, a second
later the bricks toppled down, burying the anvil
and frame out of sight.</p>

<small>ANOTHER ROBBERY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the dust cleared away the blacksmith,
who was rather pale, stepped forward and clasped
Dan by the hand.</p>

<p>“I owe my life to you,” he said, his voice
trembling in spite of himself. “I could not have
gotten out of the way if you had not helped me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess you might have managed somehow,”
replied Dan, for he did not like to hear
himself praised so highly.</p>

<p>“No, I could not. The frame would have held
me, and I would now be lying dead under those
bricks, Dan.”</p>

<p>“I am glad I was here to help you.”</p>

<p>“I meant to have the forge chimney repaired
some time ago,” went on the blacksmith. “I noticed
a large crack in it, but I kept putting it off
from time to time. This has taught me a lesson,
that delay is dangerous.”</p>

<p>“It will need quite some repairing now.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>“Yes, it will have to be rebuilt. And this decides
me. I shall now give up the blacksmith work
for ever. I have finished all the contracts I had,
except this frame, and that can be done elsewhere.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do then, Mr. Harrison?”</p>

<p>“I shall close up the shop until I find a purchaser
for it. Then I will repair the chimney. In the
meanwhile I shall proceed with the work of erecting
my little machine shop. I have the arrangements
all made, and there is no need of delaying
further. How would you like to learn to be a
machinist?”</p>

<p>“Very much, I think. Would I get a chance to
study?”</p>

<p>“That would be part of your work. I should
expect you to devote some of your time to your
books. My plans are not all made yet, and I may
have something to say to you, later, on this point.
But the more you can study, the better machinist
you will make, and, in time, you may become a
mechanical engineer, which, I believe, you told me
you would like to be.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I would.”</p>

<p>“Very well then, now we’ll close up this shop. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
seems strange to do so, for I have made my living
out of it for a number of years, and I feel attached
to it.”</p>

<p>“You are not going to move out of the house,
are you?”</p>

<p>“Not at present. It is rather small, but, if you
do not complain about the cramped quarters, I’m
sure I shall not.”</p>

<p>“I am only too glad to live there with you,” said
Dan. “It is very good of you to keep me.”</p>

<p>“I am not going to lose sight of you after this,”
remarked Mr. Harrison with a smile. “I may
want you to save my life again,” and, though he
smiled, there was a serious note in his voice, for his
escape had been a narrow one.</p>

<p>“I am going to build a house near my machine
shop,” the blacksmith went on, “but it will be some
time before it is done. Meanwhile we will continue
to live in the cottage. Now, Dan, come on, we
will lock up the old shop, and I do not expect to
enter it again until I bring a purchaser for it.”</p>

<p>The door was locked, not without a feeling of
regret on the part of the old soldier, for in spite of
his hard work, there were many pleasant associations
connected with the forge that now lay in
ruins.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>As the two were closing up the blacksmith shop,
Silas Martin, the hired man of Dr. Maxwell’s,
drove past.</p>

<p>“What’s th’ matter?” he asked. “Takin’ a
holiday an’ goin’ fishin’, Mr. Harrison?”</p>

<p>“Well, we’re taking a holiday because we have
to. The forge has fallen apart.”</p>

<p>“Bless my pitchfork!” exclaimed Silas, who was
given to odd expressions. “Ye don’t say so! Why
that forge was built nearly fifty years ago, I’ve
heard my father say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was quite an old shop when I bought
it, and that is twenty years ago. It has seen its
best days, like some of us, Silas. I suppose you
haven’t had any more robbers out your way?”</p>

<p>“No, an’ we don’t want ’em.”</p>

<p>“Have they discovered any more clues?” asked
Dan anxiously, for as the weeks went by, without
any new evidence being brought out, he began to
worry about the results of his trial.</p>

<p>“No more clues,” replied Silas. “Doc was talkin’
th’ other day of hirin’ a city detective, ef them
constables didn’t do suthin’ pretty soon. Between
you an’ me an’ the hitchin’ post,” he went on in a
whisper, “I don’t believe them constables know
beans about catchin’ burglars.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“I agree with you,” said Mr. Harrison with a
laugh.</p>

<p>“G’lang!” exclaimed Silas to his horse. “Got
t’ hurry back,” he added, as he drove off. “Doc’s
waitin’ fer me.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if those robbers will ever be caught,
so that I will be cleared of suspicion?” spoke Dan,
with something of a sigh.</p>

<p>“Don’t you worry,” advised the old soldier. “It
will all come right in time.”</p>

<p>Dan and his friend went to the small cottage
where they lived. It was a humble home, but neat
and clean, for Dan took pride in keeping it in
order. Mr. Harrison said it was more like a home
to him than it had ever been before, for Dan had
learned many housekeeping ways from Mrs. Savage,
mean as she had been to him.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison lost no time in arranging to have
his machine shop finished. This necessitated him
going away from home quite often during the next
few weeks, and Dan was left alone. He did not
mind this as it gave him time for studying, which
he had to neglect while he was working for Mr.
Savage.</p>

<p>One morning as the two were at the partly completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
shop, watching the workmen, Constable
Wolff came along.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I s’pose ye heard th’ news?” he said in
a questioning tone.</p>

<p>“No. What news?” asked Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“Why, Hank Lee’s store was robbed last night.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Lee’s store robbed!” exclaimed Dan.</p>

<p>“Yep,” went on the constable, as if he was delighted
at it, as, indeed, he was secretly, as it gave
him a chance to do something, even if it was not
very much. “They bursted open a winder, same
as they done at Dr. Maxwell’s an’ cleaned out th’
cash drawer, besides takin’ a lot of cigars.”</p>

<p>“Have you any clues?” asked the old soldier.
“Do you suspect Dan of this crime?” and he
smiled a little bitterly.</p>

<p>“No, sir, Dan ain’t suspicioned of this. We
know he didn’t have nothin’ t’ do with it, ’cause
Dr. Maxwell seen th’ two men what did th’ robbing!”</p>

<p>“He did? Then maybe they are the same persons
who robbed his place!” exclaimed Dan. “Tell
me about it, Mr. Wolff.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>EXCITEMENT IN TOWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> constable liked nothing better than a
chance to talk about something he was concerned
in. He sat down on a pile of lumber and leisurely
related the story of the robbery. As he took quite
a long time at it, perhaps it will be better if I condense
his story into a few words.</p>

<p>In brief, then, Mr. Lee had come down as usual
that morning to open his store. He noticed nothing
strange until he reached the cigar case, which
he found almost emptied of its contents. That
made him suspicious, and he hurried to the money
drawer where he had left about fifty dollars. It
was all gone. Next an opened window attracted
his attention, and he saw that it had been pried up
with some instrument, allowing the thieves to
enter.</p>

<p>“But I thought you said Dr. Maxwell saw the
two thieves,” spoke Dan, when the constable had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
told that much, and had not mentioned the more
important part of the story.</p>

<p>“So I did. I’m comin’ t’ that ef ye give me
time. It was this way. Th’ Doc was out on a late
call—I think it was t’ Mrs. Tillman’s daughter,
Nancy; she’s quite sick. He was comin’ back along
th’ road about one o’clock this mornin’, all alone,
fer Si Martin run a rusty nail in his hand, an’
can’t drive.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, th’ way Doc tells it, jest as he got near
Hank’s store he seen a light in it. He thought it
was sort of queer fer Hank t’ be keepin’ open, but
he figered that mebby he were balancin’ his books.
Anyhow th’ Doc got a notion he’d like a cigar, an’
he saw a chance t’ go in an’ buy one. So he
stopped his hoss in front of th’ store an’ started up
th’ steps.</p>

<p>“He must a’ scared th’ burglars, fer, th’ next
minute two men jumped out of th’ side winder
they’d busted open, an’ they set off lickity-split
down th’ road. ’Fore he knowed what were goin’
on, Doc he seen ’em jump in a carriage, that was
hitched t’ a tree, in a dark place, an’ they druv
off.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t he give an alarm?” asked Mr. Harrison.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“No, he didn’t,” replied the constable, “an’
that’s what he’d oughter done. I live near Hank’s
store, an’ if I’d a heard Doc yell fer help I’d a
come on th’ run, and we’d had th’ burglars now.
As it was, Doc thought mebby it might be boys
playin’ a trick on Hank, and he didn’t say
nothin’. He got back in his carriage an’ druv
home.”</p>

<p>“Then how did you know he saw the robbers?”
asked Dan.</p>

<p>“Soon as Hank discovered he’d been robbed, it
become known all over town. Si Martin come in
fer some groceries, an’ he heard it. Then he told
Doc when he got back, an’ Doc, puttin’ two an’
two together, knowed them fellers he seen were th’
burglars. He come right over an’ told me, an’
I’m workin’ on th’ case now.” And then the constable
departed.</p>

<p>“I wonder if they can be the same two thieves
who got into the doctor’s house?” said Dan.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” spoke Mr. Harrison. “At any rate,
I think this will be in your favor. A second robbery,
much like the first, will show that you are
not the only burglar in town, Dan,” and the old
soldier laughed.</p>

<p>“And I think I can prove a good alibi in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
case,” said Dan, joining in the merriment. “I was
with you all last night.”</p>

<p>As the construction of the machine shop was at
a point where it needed much attention from Mr.
Harrison, he wasted no more time thinking of the
robbery of Hank Lee’s store. Nor did Dan,
though he vaguely wondered who the burglars
might be, and if they were the same ones who had
stolen the doctor’s silver.</p>

<p>When Mr. Harrison and Dan went home for
dinner that noon, they received an unpleasant surprise.
They met Truem Mellock near their cottage.
Truem was a sort of village gossip, being a
lazy, shiftless man, who did odd jobs enough to
make a bare living, but who would stick at nothing
long.</p>

<p>“I s’pose ye heard all about th’ robbery?” he
said.</p>

<p>“I think we have, unless they have caught the
burglars,” replied Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“No, they ain’t yet, but if Hank had his way,
theer’d be an arrest made.”</p>

<p>“An arrest? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I ain’t tellin’ no secret when I say he
suspects some one.”</p>

<p>“Who is it?” inquired Dan, with a sinking
feeling at his heart.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“He’s splutterin’ around, sayin’ you could tell
suthin’ about it, ef ye wanted t’.”</p>

<p>“Me?” exclaimed Dan.</p>

<p>“Yep,” and Truem nodded vigorously. “He
ain’t exactly sayin’ ye done it, but he thinks ye
might be in with th’ gang, same as ye was—I mean
he says ye was—with th’ fellers that got Dr. Maxwell’s
silver.”</p>

<p>“Truem, do you mean to say that Hank is accusing
Dan of robbing his store?” asked Mr. Harrison
sternly, for Truem was sometimes given to
“stretching” things when retailing a bit of village
gossip.</p>

<p>“That’s what he’s practically doin’, Mr. Harrison.
I heard him myself.”</p>

<p>“Come, Dan,” said the old soldier quietly.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to make Hank Lee apologize to you,
or else make him prove his charge. This is outrageous!
Truem, you come with us.”</p>

<p>“I’d—I’d ruther not. Hank might not like—”</p>

<p>“Very well then. I suppose if he told you he
told other persons. But I’ll stop him from uttering
such slanders against an innocent lad. Come
along, Dan.”</p>

<p>The two started for the heart of the village,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
where Hank’s store was situated. On the way
they were made aware that the robbery had created
much excitement, for there was quite a throng in
the main street. Everyone seemed to be headed
for the store, as it was not often the villagers got
a chance to look at a place where burglars had been
at work.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />


<small>A QUEER FIND</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dan</span> and Mr. Harrison found quite a crowd
gathered about Hank’s store. Some were inside,
where they gazed in open-mouthed wonder at the
broken window, and looked at the cigar case,
stripped of most of its contents.</p>

<p>Hank was kept so busy answering questions, and
telling over again, for perhaps the twentieth time,
the story of how he had discovered the robbery,
that he could not wait on customers.</p>

<p>“Soon’s as I see them cigars gone, I knowed I’d
been robbed,” said Hank.</p>

<p>“May I have a few words with you?” inquired
Mr. Harrison, entering with Dan, and interrupting
the storekeeper’s recital.</p>

<p>“What about?” asked Hank, in no friendly
tone of voice.</p>

<p>“About this robbery.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’ve told all I know. I was jest tellin’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Mrs. Spriggs here about it, and if ye want to listen
I s’pose there ain’t no law against it.”</p>

<p>“That’s the trouble, you’ve been talking too
much about this case,” said the old soldier
sternly. He was a man who went straight to
the point.</p>

<p>“Too much? What d’ ye mean? Guess I’ve
got a right to say what I please about my own
affairs.”</p>

<p>“You have, about your own business, but not
about that of any one else.”</p>

<p>“What d’ ye mean?”</p>

<p>It was plain to see that Mr. Lee was uneasy.
Those in the store crowded up closer to hear the
conversation between him and the former blacksmith.</p>

<p>“I mean you have practically accused Dan
Hardy of robbing your store.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say he really done it.”</p>

<p>“Do you deny you said he ought to be arrested,
and that he could tell something about it if he
wanted to?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, s’posin’ I did say so?”</p>

<p>“You have no right to say so. It is a scandal,
and you are liable to damages for it.”</p>

<p>“Not if it’s the truth!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Then you still maintain that he robbed your
store? Be careful of what you say!”</p>

<p>“I don’t say he done it. What I did say, an’
I say it ag’in, is that a fellow that robbed one
place will rob another.”</p>

<p>“How do you know he robbed one place?”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he found guilty of robbing the doctor’s
house?”</p>

<p>“No, and you know he was not. At the very
worst there is only a suspicion against him, and a
wicked and unjust suspicion it is.”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I don’t say Dan robbed my store, but
I’ve got my suspicions that he might know suthin’
of the gang that did.”</p>

<p>“That’s not so!” exclaimed Dan hotly, unable
to control himself any longer.</p>

<p>“Easy, Dan,” counseled Mr. Harrison in a low
voice. Then addressing the storekeeper he went
on: “Now I want to warn you, Mr. Lee. I heard
the rumors you were circulating about Dan, and if
I hear any more I shall take legal means to stop
you. I am not the poor blacksmith I was, and I’ll
spend considerable money to bring you to court,
to answer for it, if you spread any more scandal
about this boy. I should think you’d be ashamed
of yourself to harm one who never injured you!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>“He set a bull after me once,” muttered Mr.
Lee.</p>

<p>But the mention of the bull, and the memory of
what had happened, set the crowd to laughing.</p>

<p>“There is no need of going into that old story
now,” went on Mr. Harrison. “I have given you
fair warning. You can talk about the robbery as
much as you please, but any reference to Dan
Hardy, as one of the robbers, must not be made.”</p>

<p>“No, it ain’t right,” put in Constable Wolff,
coming into the store at that moment.</p>

<p>“Got any new evidence?” asked a man in the
crowd.</p>

<p>“Some, yep. I jest come back from talkin’ t’
Dr. Maxwell. He says both th’ burglars was
grown men, so that let’s Dan out. I knowed he
didn’t have any hand in this, an’ I’ve got my s’picions
that maybe he didn’t rob th’ doctor’s house.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Dan sincerely.</p>

<p>“Yep, I’m inclined t’ think it was th’ same gang
that done Hank out of his money,” the constable
went on. “I’ve got some clues t’ work on now.”</p>

<p>“I think you ought to beg Dan’s pardon for
what you have said,” went on Mr. Harrison, turning
to the storekeeper again. “It is very unjust to
him, and you may yet have to answer for it.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>The old soldier looked sturdy standing there,
with Dan by his side, and the fact that he had
plenty of money to go to law with if he chose,
rather made Mr. Lee worry.</p>

<p>“Wa’al,” he said, “mebby I was a bit hasty sayin’
Dan might know suthin’ about it. I s’pose he
don’t.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I don’t,” replied Dan earnestly.</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’ll not mention it any more,” and that
was about as much as could be expected from a
man like Hank Lee. Even this partial apology
came hard for him, and Mr. Harrison was satisfied.</p>

<p>“While we’re here we might as well take a look
at where the burglars got in,” said the former
blacksmith to Dan, as the storekeeper resumed his
telling of the tale for the twentieth time.</p>

<p>They went to the rear of the store, which was
pretty well deserted by this time, nearly all of the
crowd having gazed as long as they wanted to at
the broken window.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison and Dan went to the casement,
the sash of which had been shattered.</p>

<p>“They must have used some powerful instrument,”
spoke the old soldier.</p>

<p>“Yes, there are the marks of it on the window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
sill,” added Dan, pointing to some deep indentations.</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison stepped back. As he did so his
foot hit against something that gave out a ringing
sound, like a piece of iron when it is struck. He
looked down, and saw something shiny amid a
small pile of waste papers. He picked it up, and,
as he did so he uttered a low murmur of astonishment.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“It is the instrument I once mended for that
mysterious stranger who was in town some months
ago! The man who was talking to you. I recognize
this tool by the way it is welded together.
It is my work. I wonder how it came here?”</p>

<p>“What’s that ye got?” asked a voice from behind
the former blacksmith, and the two turned
around to see Constable Wolff looking over their
shoulders at the queer find.</p>

<p>“I just picked it up on the floor,” replied Mr.
Harrison. “What is it?”</p>

<p>“What is it?” repeated the constable in an excited
voice. “What is it? Why it’s what I’ve been
looking for! It’s a burglar’s tool—a jimmy they
call ’em! It’s what they used t’ pry open winders
with. That’s th’ best clue yet!”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Mr. Harrison looked at Dan in a significant
manner, and, when the constables turned aside for
a moment, the old soldier placed his finger across
his lips, to warn the lad to say nothing.</p>

<p>“Look a-here!” exclaimed the constable, unable
to keep the news of the find to himself. “Here’s
th’ jimmy th’ burglars used. They dropped it
right under th’ winder!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br />


<small>ON THE WATCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> announcement of the constable excited the
crowd, and the men and boys gathered around to
look at the queer tool.</p>

<p>“It looks like a big tack lifter,” remarked one
man.</p>

<p>“Th’ robbers used it fer a winder lifter,” added
another. “Here, Hank,” he called, “come and see
how the burglars got in your store.”</p>

<p>“Now is a good chance for us to get out, without
being asked too many questions,” said Mr.
Harrison to Dan, in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you want to answer questions?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you presently; I think I am on the
track of a discovery.”</p>

<p>“About the burglars?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But come outside.”</p>

<p>Few paid any attention to Dan and the old
soldier. There was much curiosity to view the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
burglar’s jimmy, and Constable Wolff was in his
element explaining just how the instruments were
used, for he had read about them.</p>

<p>“Dan,” said Mr. Harrison, when they were out
on the street, proceeding toward the new machine
shop, “I think we are on the verge of a great discovery.
I did not want the people in the store to
question me about the jimmy, as they surely would
if I had remained. They might have gotten on the
track of something.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that is the same tool you mended
for that well dressed man?”</p>

<p>“I am sure of it. At the time I welded it I did
not know what it was. I took his word that he was
an inventor, and this was some new kind of instrument.
But now—”</p>

<p>“Now you think he was a burglar and robbed
Mr. Lee’s store?” finished Dan with a smile.</p>

<p>“Yes, and more than that. I think he was the
one who robbed the doctor’s house. He had some
one with him, but I am sure he used a jimmy. Now
we shall have to prove that the same person, or
persons, who robbed the store robbed the doctor’s
house.”</p>

<p>“How are you going to do it?”</p>

<p>“I think I can apply a few principles of common<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
sense to this case, and it may result in getting some
valuable information.”</p>

<p>“I hope it gets the robbers.”</p>

<p>“That is another matter; but it may. At any
rate we shall know whether or not we are on the
right track.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see how you can tell whether the
same person who broke into Mr. Lee’s store, also
broke into the house of Dr. Maxwell.”</p>

<p>“I’ll show you pretty soon. I wish you would
go to the old blacksmith shop, and get me the dividers
I used to use. You will find them over the
work bench.”</p>

<p>“I know where they are. I’ll get them.”</p>

<p>“You might bring both pairs. I think we shall
need them.”</p>

<p>“I will do so.”</p>

<p>Dividers, it may be explained, are simply
compasses, such as are used in school to draw circles
with. They are made of steel, however, and
have no pencil in them, both points being quite
sharp. In addition there is an arrangement so that
they can be opened to any desired width, and
fastened there. They are used by mechanics to
take exact measurements.</p>

<p>Dan found the two instruments where the former<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
blacksmith had told him they were, and
brought them away with him.</p>

<p>“Now I think we are ready to proceed with our
detective work,” observed Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“Where are you going to start?”</p>

<p>“At Mr. Lee’s store.”</p>

<p>Reaching this place, they found that there were
now very few persons in the vicinity, nearly every one
having satisfied his curiosity regarding the
broken window.</p>

<p>“I am glad there is no one likely to see what we
are about to do,” remarked the old soldier. “They
might ask too many questions, and spoil my
plans.”</p>

<p>Instead of going inside the store, as Dan expected
he would, Mr. Harrison went to a spot just
outside the window by which the burglars had
entered.</p>

<p>“Now if you will hold one pair of dividers, I
will use the other,” he said.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I am going to measure the width and length of
the dents made in the window sill by the burglar’s
jimmy.”</p>

<p>In the wooden sill were two deep indentations,
where the jimmy had sunk down, as the burglars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
pried on it, when the thin edge of the tool was
under the edge of the window sash. The two indentations
were just alike, so there was no need to
measure but one.</p>

<p>Long practice with the dividers had made Mr.
Harrison skillful in their use. In a few seconds he
had set the sharp points at the extreme edges of
one indentation. Then he fastened them there
with the set-screw.</p>

<p>“Now, Dan, you hold these, and be careful not
to jam them against anything,” he said. “Hand
me the other pair.”</p>

<p>Dan did so. Mr. Harrison then measured the
length of the indentation or dent, in the same way.</p>

<p>“Good!” he exclaimed, when he had finished.
“No one has seen us. Now, Dan, we must hurry
away from here.”</p>

<p>“Where are we going now?”</p>

<p>“To Dr. Maxwell’s house. I think you can
guess what for. Can’t you?”</p>

<p>“Is it to measure the dents made by the burglars
in the window sill there, and compare them with
these?”</p>

<p>“Exactly; and if we find they correspond, as I
think we shall, we will know that the same man
committed both crimes.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>“And that man was the mysterious stranger who
was talking to me.”</p>

<p>“Yes. Or at least one of the gang.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if we shall ever catch him?”</p>

<p>“It is hard to say, but it is a good deal easier to
catch some particular person, than one of whom
you know nothing.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is so. Oh, I do hope we can catch
him, and that will prove that I am innocent!”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best, Dan.”</p>

<p>It did not take them long to get to Dr. Maxwell’s
house. The physician was not at home, but
from his wife they readily obtained permission to
measure the indentations left in the window sill by
the burglars’ jimmy.</p>

<p>“Do you think you are on the track of the robbers?”
asked Mrs. Maxwell.</p>

<p>“We hope so,” replied Mr. Harrison, “but I
wish you would kindly say nothing about it, as it
may spoil my plans.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not. I hope for Dan’s sake that the burglars
are discovered. We never for a moment suspected
him. His mother was an old friend of
mine.”</p>

<p>“Thank you very much,” said Dan, his heart
warming toward the physician’s good wife, at her
kind words.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>It was the work of but a few moments to compare,
by means of the dividers, the dents in the
doctor’s window with those in Hank’s store.</p>

<p>“They are exactly the same,” announced Mr.
Harrison. “I thought we should find them so.
That slick stranger is guilty of both robberies.”</p>

<p>“The next thing to do is to find him,” said Dan,
“and I am afraid that will be harder work.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will,” admitted the old soldier, “but
the battle has only just begun. Up to now we have
been skirmishing. Now I am going to unlimber
my heavy guns.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>“I am going to hire the best private detective I
can get to prove your innocence, and arrest the
real robbers!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br />


<small>THE CLUE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dan</span> was not prepared for this announcement.
Tears came into his eyes as he realized how much
Mr. Harrison was willing to do for him.</p>

<p>“It will cost a good deal of money,” he said a
little doubtfully.</p>

<p>“Well, I am glad I can afford it, Dan. I never
had the chance to spend much money, and now
that I have more than I need, I am only too glad
to aid you with some of it. But we must lose no
time. Every hour counts. I think I shall telegraph
for the detective. The two constables we
have here are worse than useless, when it comes to
discovering real criminals.”</p>

<p>On getting back to the village Mr. Harrison
sent a message to a well known private detective
firm in New York. He got an answer that a competent
man would arrive the next day.</p>

<p>“If I had stopped to think,” said Dan, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
they were talking matters over that night, “I might
have suspected that the well dressed man, who
asked me so many questions about the village and
the people, was the one who robbed the doctor’s
house. He made particular inquiries regarding
him.”</p>

<p>“Well, you had enough else to think about then,
to excuse you for not getting on the right track.
However, better late than never.”</p>

<p>“I hope we shall not be too late.”</p>

<p>The detective arrived the next afternoon. He
was a quiet man, not at all resembling the picture
Dan had formed in his mind as to how a detective
should look. Indeed, this one resembled a traveling
salesman more than anything else.</p>

<p>He came at once to the cottage where Dan and
the old soldier lived, and Mr. Harrison was there
waiting for him. The robberies were carefully explained
to the detective, and then the matter of
finding the jimmy, and measuring the marks.</p>

<p>“Do you think I am right in my conclusions?”
asked Mr. Harrison, when he had finished.</p>

<p>“I do. I think there is no doubt but that both
jobs were done by the same man or men. That he
was the person you refer to I also have no doubt.
Now the thing is to catch him. I must make inquiries,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
and do it in a quiet way. It will be better
for neither of you to seem to know me, so, if you
meet me in the village, or this neighborhood, do
not pay any attention to me.”</p>

<p>The reason for this request was well understood,
and, after getting more information, and promising
to report as soon as he had anything definite to
tell them, the detective took his departure.</p>

<p>“Do you think he will find the man?” asked
Dan.</p>

<p>“I hope so. These detectives are highly trained.
Still it is no easy matter to locate a criminal when
he has had several hours in which to make his
escape. We will hope for the best.”</p>

<p>Several days passed, during which time Mr.
Harrison and Dan were kept busy at the new shop.
Work there was progressing rapidly, and the
machinery would soon be put in.</p>

<p>“Seems as though we should hear something
from that detective,” Dan remarked one evening,
after supper.</p>

<p>“You are naturally anxious, Dan. I admit I
am myself. I should like to hear some news—good
news that is—Hark! I think I hear some
one coming up the walk.”</p>

<p>There was no doubt that some one was approaching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
the cottage. A knock was heard at the
door, and Dan opened it to admit the detective,
who had given his name as Mr. Roscoe.</p>

<p>“Any news?” asked the old soldier eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, not much,” replied Mr. Roscoe, sinking
rather wearily in a chair. “I was on the track of
your man, but I lost him. I had an accident. The
carriage I was riding in broke down, and I got to
a certain town, just half an hour after he left.”</p>

<p>“Then he is in this vicinity?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he has been since the second robbery. I
learned also that he is in company with a rather
poorly dressed person. Probably the two work
together.”</p>

<p>“Have you learned the name of that well
dressed, mysterious stranger?” asked Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“Yes, he goes by the name of Julius Galt, though
I suppose that is only one of many aliases.”</p>

<p>“How did you get on his track?” asked Dan.</p>

<p>“By making inquiries. I had a good description
of the fellow, and it was easier here to ask persons
whom I met than it would have been in a city,
for, around here, strangers are not common, and
nearly every farmer takes notice of them.</p>

<p>“I traced Galt from town to town. He seems<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
to be doing nothing, but is well supplied with
money. There have been one or two robberies
committed recently, and I think he had a hand in
them.”</p>

<p>“Where is he now?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I’d like to know. I had to come
back because I ran out of money, and I have to pay
cash for the hire of carriages, and for railroad
fare. Galt, when I had to turn back, was headed
for a town about twenty-five miles from here,
called Redcliff. If you can lend me some money
until I can telegraph to headquarters for funds, I
will get right after him again.”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” agreed Mr. Harrison, taking some
bills from his pocket. “But won’t you stay and
have some supper?”</p>

<p>“No, I can’t spare the time. I must keep right
after him. I can eat somewhere along the way.
Now I’m off again. Good bye.”</p>

<p>“It looks as if he would get him,” said Dan,
when the detective had closed the door.</p>

<p>“I hope he does. He seems like a good officer.”</p>

<p>Three days went by, and no word came from the
detective. Dan was beginning to lose hope, and it
vanished completely when, on the following day a
telegram came from the officer, stating that he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
again lost track of the man. The detective added
that he would be in Hayden that night, to start on
a new clue.</p>

<p>“He’s got to begin all over again,” said Dan,
in a despondent tone. “And my trial comes off in
about two weeks. If Galt is not arrested they may
convict me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Dan. Somehow I feel as if something
was going to happen—something good.”</p>

<p>“I wish it would hurry up and happen then.”</p>

<p>“You must get your mind off your trouble.
Suppose you take a ride with me. I have to drive
over to Tompkins Corners to see about some machinery.
The ride will do you good.”</p>

<p>“I should like to go.”</p>

<p>“Then get ready, and I’ll have the carriage here
in a little while.”</p>

<p>Since coming into his inheritance Mr. Harrison
purchased a horse and carriage, for he found it
necessary to go from place to place to transact his
new business.</p>

<p>Dan and the old soldier were soon driving along
the fine country road, in the direction of Tompkins
Corners. They were both thinking of the robbery
and the detective, wondering what new clue he
would start on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>“Here comes Mr. Savage,” announced Dan, as
he saw a man approaching driving a horse and
wagon.</p>

<p>“So it is. He looks pleased over something.”</p>

<p>This was true, for Mr. Savage was smiling
broadly, a thing he seldom did.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” greeted Mr. Harrison, for
though the two men were not very friendly since
the trouble over Dan, they were still on speaking
terms.</p>

<p>“Mornin’,” responded Mr. Savage.</p>

<p>“You look as though something pleased you,”
went on the former blacksmith.</p>

<p>“Suthin’ has. I got back some money a feller
cheated me out of.”</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>“Wa’al, I’ll tell ye,” spoke Mr. Savage, drawing
up his horse, an example followed by Mr.
Harrison. “Some time ago a feller gave me a
bad quarter—Dan knows about it,” and he nodded
at the boy. “It was a feller that took a lot of
Dan’s time talkin’ when he’d oughter be shellin’
corn, an’ I charged him fer it.”</p>

<p>“That man?” asked Dan excitedly, nudging
Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“That’s th’ feller.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Mr. Savage seemed to have forgotten some of
his vindictiveness against Dan, because of getting
a good quarter for a bad one.</p>

<p>“Where did you see him?” asked Mr. Harrison,
trying to speak calmly, for he felt they were now
on the track of the robber. “Where was he?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell ye how it was. I was over t’ Denville
this mornin’ doin’ a leetle business, an’ I stopped
off at th’ hotel t’ see a man. Soon’s I went in th’
hall I seen this feller in th’ barroom.”</p>

<p>“Did he know you?” asked Mr. Harrison
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Not at fust. I didn’t like t’ go in a barroom,
seein’ as how I’m strict temp’rence, but I figured
I oughter have my rightful money, so I went in.
I went up to t’ that feller, an’ I says says I, ‘Here’s
ye’r counterfeit money back, an’ I want a good
piece fer it, or I’ll have ye arrested.’ My, but he
was took back! Then he begun t’ laugh, an’ pretend
it were all a mistake. He said that was a
lucky pocket piece of his’n, an’ he regretted at
losin’ it. I said he could have it back an’ welcome,
an’ he took it, an’ give me back fifty cents. Said
th’ other quarter were fer interest. He
wanted me t’ have a drink, but I took a cigar
instid.”</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“Is he going to stay there?” asked Mr. Harrison.</p>

<p>“It looked so. Said he was thinkin’ about
openin’ a store in town.”</p>

<p>Dan and Mr. Harrison both thought that the
only way Galt would “open” a store would be with
a jimmy.</p>

<p>“So you got your money back,” remarked Mr.
Harrison, desiring to close the conversation, and
make use of the clue so unexpectedly given.</p>

<p>“I did, twice over, an’ I’m satisfied. Ye don’t
want t’ come back t’ th’ farm, do ye, Dan?”</p>

<p>“No, thank you; not as long as Mr. Harrison
will keep me.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he’ll soon git tired of ye. Wa’al, I’ll
fergive an’ overlook th’ past, ef ye want t’ come
back.”</p>

<p>“If he does I’ll let you know,” said the old soldier,
as he started up his horse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br />


<small>CATCHING THE BURGLARS—CONCLUSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">That’s</span> a great piece of news,” commented Dan,
when Mr. Savage had driven off down the road.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is. We must act quickly. I wish Mr.
Roscoe was here now. But he’ll be here to-night,
and we can send him right over to Denville to
make the arrest.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it would be a good thing for us to do it
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“No, I think not. As soon as Galt saw you he
would flee, and might escape. He wouldn’t
know Mr. Roscoe. Besides I think it likely he is
planning a robbery in Denville, and he will stay
there until he has done the job.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison and Dan transacted their business
and returned to Hayden. Then they had an
anxious wait until evening, when the detective was
expected back.</p>

<p>“I never knew such a long afternoon,” remarked
Dan, about four o’clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>They were at supper when Mr. Roscoe came
in.</p>

<p>“No good news,” was the detective’s first remark,
given in despondent tones. “He’s a slippery,
customer, that Galt.”</p>

<p>Mr. Harrison quickly related what the farmer
had told him.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll start at once for Denville,” decided
the detective. “Come on. I may need help.”</p>

<p>The house was locked up and the three started
off.</p>

<p>“Shall we hire a carriage at the livery stable?”
asked Mr. Harrison. “Mine is rather small.”</p>

<p>“It will be better to take yours, even if we are a
little crowded, than to go to a public place, and
cause comment. We shall manage. Can your horse
travel fast?” asked the detective.</p>

<p>“Fairly so. It is only five miles to Denville.”</p>

<p>They were soon on their way through the
gathering darkness, for it was now fall, and the
sun went down early.</p>

<p>“I only hope he stays at the hotel until we
arrive,” murmured Mr. Roscoe. “I never was
after such a slippery fellow as he is. Every time
I thought I had him he was somewhere else.”</p>

<p>The last mile seemed the longest of all, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Dan thought some one must have pulled up the
marking stone, and set it down about twice as far
ahead as it ought to be. But at last they came in
sight of the village of Denville, and a little later
they arrived at the hotel.</p>

<p>“You had better let me go ahead,” suggested
the detective. “I am used to this part of the game.
If he saw you he might make a bolt to escape before
I could prevent him.”</p>

<p>Accordingly, after leaving the horse and carriage
under the hotel shed, Dan and Mr. Harrison
remained in the shadow on the hotel porch, while
Mr. Roscoe went inside. He came out in a few
moments.</p>

<p>“Galt is in the barroom, playing cards,” he announced.
“I am going in and arrest him. You
had better stay at the front door, Mr. Harrison,
and make a grab if he comes out that way. Dan,
you go around back, and get one of the stablemen
to help you, if he makes a bolt out that way. I
will wait three minutes for you to get there, and
place yourself.”</p>

<p>Dan hurried around to the rear, and enlisted the
services of a stout Irish groom, briefly explaining
what was about to take place.</p>

<p>Mr. Roscoe entered the barroom. At a table<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
was Galt, dealing cards to a number of men.
Among them was a rather poorly dressed individual,
somewhat the worse for liquor.</p>

<p>No one paid any attention to the detective. Mr.
Roscoe walked quietly up to the table and, looking
at Galt said:</p>

<p>“I want you to come with me.”</p>

<p>“Well, I like your impudence!” exclaimed the
man. “Who are you? And why should I go with
you?”</p>

<p>“I would have explained privately if you had
taken my hint,” said the officer suggestively. “I
am a detective, and I place you under arrest for
the robbery of the house of Dr. Maxwell, and the
store of Hank Lee.”</p>

<p>Galt jumped to his feet. Before he could make
a move the detective had snapped a pair of handcuffs
on his wrists.</p>

<p>“Now, I want you also,” he added, turning to
the shabbily dressed man.</p>

<p>“Wan’ me? Wha’ fer?” was the stupid inquiry.</p>

<p>“As the accomplice in these robberies,” and the
partly intoxicated man was also handcuffed.</p>

<p>As might be expected the arrest created intense
excitement. Men crowded around the detective and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
his prisoners, but Mr. Harrison who had been
watching through the glass door, entered quickly
and took charge of the semi-intoxicated person,
while Mr. Roscoe managed Galt.</p>

<p>Then Dan, who heard the commotion, and saw
that no escape was being attempted, went in.
At Mr. Roscoe’s suggestion the boy telephoned to
the police of Denville, a couple of officers arrived,
and the two prisoners were soon in the town lock-up.</p>

<p>“We will take them to Hayden in the morning,”
said the detective. “Well, I’m glad this job is
over.”</p>

<p>“So am I!” exclaimed Dan joyfully. “My innocence
can now be proved.”</p>

<p>Amid great excitement the prisoners were
brought to Hayden early the following day. The
news spread like wildfire that the men who robbed
Hank Lee’s store had been captured. A big crowd
gathered at the jail.</p>

<p>“So they’ve got th’ rascals, eh?” asked Hank,
when some one told him. “I’ll go have a look
at ’em. Did they say Dan Hardy was one of their
gang?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied the man who brought
the news.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>Hank lost no time in going to the jail. The
prisoners were just being taken to cells. Hank
gave one look at the poorly dressed man, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Simon!”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that you?” asked the man. “Hello,
Hank! You ain’t goin’ t’ prosecute your own
brother, fer takin’ a few cigars, are you?”</p>

<p>“Brother? Are you his brother?” asked Mr.
Harrison of the prisoner.</p>

<p>“That’s what I am. I’m his own brother, Simon
Lee.”</p>

<p>“My good-for-nothing brother you mean!” exclaimed
Hank. “I disown you! You’ve disgraced
me! To think of your being a robber,” and he
was much chagrined.</p>

<p>“Oh, I didn’t do it all. Galt did the most of it.
I only helped.”</p>

<p>“Poor weak fool,” murmured Galt, who seemed
cool enough under the circumstances.</p>

<p>We need not further concern ourselves with the
burglars except to say that they both confessed to
robbing the doctor’s house, and Mr. Lee’s store.</p>

<p>There were three in the gang, but the third
member was never caught. It was also learned
that the men Dan had seen that night were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
burglars, and they were hiding the doctor’s silverware,
which they afterward removed.</p>

<p>Simon Lee, it appeared, was a man with a weak
nature. He had fallen into criminal ways, been
associated with Galt, and then had tried to reform.
For a time Galt had lost track of him, and then,
learning he had a brother who kept a store in Hayden,
he had hunted out the small village, and, on
a threat of disclosing a certain crime in which
Simon was concerned, had compelled the fellow
to join him in other illegal acts. They had planned
a robbery in Denville but were arrested before
they could accomplish it.</p>

<p>Part of Dr. Maxwell’s silver was recovered, but
Hank Lee never got any of his money back. Both
burglars were sentenced to long terms in prison
and there was never any occasion for putting Dan
on trial.</p>

<p>“Well, that turned out well, but I am sorry for
those men—sorry for their evil ways,” said the old
soldier to Dan, one day, toward the beginning of
winter, when they were in their new cottage, near
the completed machine shop.</p>

<p>“Yes, I feel as if a load had been lifted from
my shoulders,” replied the boy.</p>

<p>“I never had any doubt about the outcome, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
I am glad you were so completely and quickly
vindicated. It was quite a shock to Hank Lee, to
find his own brother had robbed him. But, Dan,
I want to talk about something pleasanter now. I
have a proposition to make to you. I have been
observing you for some time, and I have made up
my mind, if you will consent to it, that I will adopt
you as my son.”</p>

<p>“Your son?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I am all alone in the world, and so are
you. Why should we not always be together?”</p>

<p>“It is too good of you!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. It will give me something more
to live for. Then you agree?”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, and thank you so much!” and Dan’s
face showed his pleasure.</p>

<p>“Then I will have the papers drawn up at once.
Now another matter,—I have decided to send you
to school, and, if you like, to college. There is
nothing in this world like education, and the best
use I can put some of my money to is to enable
you to rise in life.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mr. Harrison. I never expected this!”</p>

<p>“Nor did I expect my legacy. It is good luck
for both of us.”</p>

<p>And so it proved. Dan acquitted himself well<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
at school, and if you should go to Hayden now
you would find it quite a thriving town, with a
large machine shop, of which Dan Hardy, no
longer a farm boy, is the head, having succeeded
to all Mr. Harrison’s interests when that good
soldier became too old to take an active part. And
here we will leave Dan Hardy and his friends, for
he has many.</p>
